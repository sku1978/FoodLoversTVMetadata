This met with limited success, however things clicked when he added in the non vegetarian dishes that he and his wife would cook at home. Eventually, his sons joined in to support this family enterprise that in a span of 46 years has come to be the de facto eatery for naati (local style) non-vegetarian oota in the area. However, there are still many outside the immediate area who are yet to discover the homely taste of the fare here. I was one of them, until I paid a surprise visit one afternoon. In doing so, I caught up with the second and third generation of Chandrappa\u2019s family and also his culinary legacy in a smorgasbord of meaty dishes.\n\nHope you enjoy this one.

The fare at Ahmedia Hotel was mostly Mughlai,  inspired by the culinary traditions of erstwhile North Arcot principality. Over decades the kitchens here have perfected time-honored recipes, amongst them a wood-fire-cooked biryani that, unusual for Tamil Nadu, favours the basmati over seeraga samba rice. I discovered Ahmedia three years ago on a #gourmetontheroad tour through the region when I met the founder and his enterprising sons. Janab Ahmed Basha has passed on since, but his sons seem determined to build on their father\u2019s legacy. And have now opened a massive 25,000 sq. ft., 250-seat Ahmedia branch on the Bengaluru Chennai highway with the conveniences required to cater to travellers. I visited them on a recent trip to Chennai, where I tasted most of my favourite dishes here, including the biryani that has put Vaniyambadi on the culinary map.\n\nHope you enjoy this episode.

A2B, as the group is popularly known, is now perhaps South India\u2019s most recognised restaurant, sweets and snacks brand, with over 150 outlets across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and overseas, however its origins are rather humble and trace an agricultural family\u2019s inspiring 60-year journey through Rajapalyam, Bengaluru, Chennai and beyond. As I learnt from the second and third generation of the Adyar Ananda Bhavan family when I visited their facility that can produce over 40,000 kilos of savouries and 10,000 kilos of sweets evry single day! \n\nWhat is heartening though is the family\u2019s commitment to sourcing quality ingredients, even making their own ghee to ensure 100% purity, and fostering an environment where the skill and craft involved in making artisanal handmade sweets is also encouraged alongside automated production lines to meet the burgeoning demand for their sweets and savouries.

From a spiced-up Margherita to a Karnataka pizza that basically incorporates almost every ingredient she has available, Amma\u2019s pizzas are slowly but surely gaining favour with the locals of Koramangala, South Bengaluru for her hygienic approach to using fresh quality ingredients and creating flavours of the sort that appeal to most mainstream palates. The name may say \u2018Italian\u2019, but these are the sort of pizzas that resonate the \u2018kadak\u2019, street vibes of namma ooru, Bengaluru.\n\nKarnataka Pizza\nRs. 200 (usd 2.4)\n9/10\n\nMargherita Pizza\nRs. 150 (usd 1.8)\n7.5/10\n\nGarlic  Bread\nRs. 90 (usd 1.1)\n8/10\n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nPs.

The menu comprised only nine items, mostly mutton, cooked by Rajanna himself with a single masala that would be ground by him at home. He passed on shortly after, but his wife and brother in law have continued his work over decades, preserving the flavour and character of the food. From a shed, it is now a tiny eatery, sans any name board, where customers queue up for rustic, village style fare served on banana leaves off granite slabs that serve as benches and tables. A recent addition also includes a basic but functional family room. I caught up with my chef friend, Sushil Dwarkanath to explore the cooking here and also make a tasty meal of their mutton delicacies.

In those days, the denizens of (then) chilly Bangalore were hesitant to eat ice creams afraid they may fall ill, and thus began a long and arduous journey of educating people to appreciate and enjoy these frozen treats. The effort seems to have paid off over the years, making this vegetarian ice cream parlour a household name amongst old Bangaloreans. From multiple outlets, Mantap has now scaled back to only one store in Seshadripuram, where Mantapa Upadhyay, (as he is popularly known) dreams up combinations that he personally puts together each morning with dairy rich ice creams that are sourced from a premium ice cream supplier. In this conversation with him and his family, I savour a range of his delectable creations - from traditional pure organic jaggery, guava chilli, to inspirations like the fruit fusion, red velvet cake, and classics like rich mango cream and caramel, and a couple of delicious faloodas too.

Selling a limited variety of pure vegetarian breads, buns and biscuits, the bakery fell upon hard times due to the rationing of flour and other essentials in the seventies. Faced with dire prospects, Ramaswamy Iyengar looked at the plentiful groundnut for survival and in doing so hit upon a unique recipe combining peanuts with a blend of spices that he named the Congress kadlekai, owing to the legend that during British times, secret notes were sent by Indian National Congress party workers hidden in sacks of groundnuts. I spent an afternoon with the second and third generation of the Sreenivasa Brahmins Bakery family to watch the making of the iconic Congress kadlekai and also taste some of the traditional items that make this 66-year-old institution a hit not just with locals, but also with Bengaluru diaspora across the globe who throng here for the kadlekai, nippat, khara buns, palya buns, puffs and other traditional Iyengar bakery treats. \n\nKBC\nRs. 35 (usd 0.5)\n8.5/10\n\nPalya bun\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\n9.5/10\n\nCapsicum puff\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\n9/10\n\nBaked nippat\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7) for a pack of 10\n8/10\n\nCongress kadlekai\n10/10\nRs. 440  (usd 5.9) per kilo\n\nBonda kadalebeeja\n8/10\nRs. 400 (usd 5.4) per kilo\n\nKadale fry\n8/10\nRs. 400 (usd 5.4) per kilo\n\nPepper kadlekai\n8.5/10\nRs. 400 (usd 5.4) per kilo\n\nHoney cake\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\n7.5/10\n\nHappy Eating!\n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nSubscribe To our second channel at https://www.youtube.com/c/KripalAmannaVlogs \n\nADDRESS - Sreenivasa Brahmins Bakery (Old outlet), Building, Shop No. 125, 1st Floor Abalashram, DVG Road, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560004, tel:- +91 78299 01153\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/boZgDF7EWCiF7jZc7   \nTIMINGS - 9am to 9pm \n\nSreenivasa Brahmins Bakery (New outlet),opposite to Dodda Ganesha temple,\nBull Temple Road, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560019, tel:- +91 78299 01153\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/VVeU416Yzv5sxjPC8    \nTIMINGS - 830am to 9pm \n\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t to be owing to an accident, necessitating him to switch tracks to a corporate career. However, after 11 years, he decided to return to his love for momos in 2010 and set up a tiny 100 sq. ft. shop in RT Nagar, North Bengaluru to serve the freshest momos. How fresh? Unlike typical momo shops which pre-cook and reheat momos to serve customers instantly, out here these steamed dumplings are prepared from scratch, from rolling out the dough to preparing the filling, only when an order is placed. This approach has won for Ronald a steady stream of customers over the years, facilitating his shop\u2019s move to a slightly larger space.

Eventually he moved to Rajajinagar in 1970 before opening a second bakery on Chord Road, West Bengaluru. What makes Variar bakery immensely popular with locals is its philosophy that \u201cexcludes artificial additives, preservatives and chemically bleached flour in its vast range of baked products.\u201d As a result, \u201cthere is no shining in our items,\u201d says second generation owner, Vijaya Shankar, who is currently on a quest to substitute, to the extent possible, detrimental fats with healthier options of unrefined oil, ghee, butter across most of their range, and in certain products, maida with wholewheat flour and grains.

Actually, it isn\u2019t even a shop, but a window in 60-something-year-old Shivappa\u2019s home from where he dispenses freshly steamed idlis (only) with home churned butter for a few hours each morning. Travellers on the route, and even those who journey from afar just to eat here, line up outside the window, even before it is flung open at 7am.\n\nShivappa\u2019s enterprise bears no signboard and he employs no one, preferring to do everything himself, from preparing the chutney and the butter to the soaking and grinding of the grain, the fermentation and steaming of the idlis, helped only by his wife. When you are here, you need to abide by his \u201cseemingly authoritarian\u201d rules - register your order, collect a token in exchange for your payment, and wait patiently for Shivappa to steam the idlis fresh and call your token number! This may seem like a bit of a drill, until you take a bite of the spicy chutney soaked idlis, and then it all seems to make sense.

Well, most begin as tentative experiments and over a period of time endear themselves to the palate of the locals. So much so that the denizens of the place become vocal ambassadors for the biryani. And when it comes to Belagavi (Belgaum), the Niyaaz biryani is one such icon. Made in the kacchi akhni style, in which semi-cooked rice is layered over twice-marinated meat and cooked on dum, the Niyaaz biryani is subtle in its character, owing to a unique blend of spices, and the light fragrance of a short-grain locally grown rice that is used in combination with the more typical long grain basmati rice. What began as a family\u2019s endeavour to create a unique biryani 30 years ago is now unarguably one of Belagavi\u2019s most popular dishes. In this episode, I drive to Belgaum to meet co-owner, Niyaaz Abdussalam Saudagar, and explore in depth the making of both the chicken and mutton biryani, before proceeding to make a meal of these distinct Belagavi culinary signatures.

Their trips back home always included tasting forays to the eateries of Durgadbail and incessant recipe experimentations to perfect the robust masalas of Hubli street fare. When he fell ill, she set up a small business catering Uttara Karnataka meals out of their home in South Bengaluru to support the family. Unfortunately, he passed on, but Bhagya Kulkarni was determined to fulfil their dream, and thus was born Agraane Kitchen, a tiny shop that serves up the Durgadbail girmit, mirchi, avalakki usli, bun bonda, cut mirchi, etc., in addition to typical breakfast offerings and an austere but wholesome jowar rotti meal during lunch. I visit them on a rainy evening to savour the spicy, snacky street fare that I missed on my recent Hubli expedition, and to also support this enterprise that in a manner of speaking, is this brave lady\u2019s culinary tribute to her late husband.

And a popular chaat destination is Karnataka Bhel House, which began as one of the earliest stores unlike food carts way back in 1975. Founded by Mr Prabhulinga Linga Dev who converted his provision store in Chamrajpet to a chaat shop on the advice of a friend who had just returned from plying the trade in Mumbai, KBH, as it is popularly known, may have branched out into spiffy operations across multiple outlets today. However, it is the consistency of the chaats here, we are told by its fans, thanks to the owning family\u2019s focus on sourcing the best ingredients, for instance, the peas that go into the masala come from the US to ensure the same taste year-round, whilst all components and condiments that go into the chaat are produced in their central kitchen, that has made Karnataka Bhel House a popular chaat destination.

In this street food episode, I stop by at Chitradurga Girmit Mandakki Centre to meet Ullas Basavaraju and his father, and also taste the Chitradurga mirchi in a scrumptiously delicious spicy avatar, some girmit mandakki masala and a rather intriguingly named \u2018operation bajji\u2019!

Which biryani should one try, should one try the Mani Biryani or the Anand Biryani? How different are these biryanis? Or are they similar? Which one is spicy, which one is not? What goes into the making of these hugely popular biryanis? Which one came first? And more\u2026 \n\nIn this special Gourmet On The Road episode, we revisit these biryanis and compare side by side Hoskote\u2019s most popular early morning biryanis, undoubtedly, in an attempt to answer many of the questions posed. Hope you enjoy this one; take care, stay safe and happy eating! \n\nAnand Mutton Biryani \nThe dominant flavours in this biryani are that of the fresh ingredients, the naati ginger, garlic, coriander,mint etc., followed by a veil of the aromatic spices. Every grain of rice is imbued with its flavours, and the meat is a combination of some soft, juicy pieces and some on the bone, that calls for a bit of effort to get to every bit of it, some fat included. The spicing is gentle and warm. \nRs. 230 (usd 3.1) \n9/10\n\nMutton Biryani\nThe only dish made at Mani Dum Biryani, is unique in its aroma that is redolent of an amalgam of spices combined with meat. Each grain of the rice has absorbed the procession of spices that go into the pot and the fat that is rendered from the meat, this is the sort of biryani that leaves behind a spicy impression on the palate. You can taste the heat of green chillies, and the flavour of the secret spice mix that\u2019s made in Mani\u2019s home. Some of the meat is laced with fat that melts in the warmth of one\u2019s mouth, some pieces though can have a bit of a bite. This is a spicy biryani, and the mosaru bhajji, onion and cucumber raitha helps cool things down.\nRs. 230 (usd 3.1)\n9/10\n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nTIMINGS: 6am to 930am on Tuesday, Friday and Sundays only.

Stay safe and happy eating!\n\nNote: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please support local eateries.\n\nTakeaway Dish Review\n\nIdli\nA coarse-grained porous idli that allows for the chutney to seep in, you can taste a slight tartness from the fermentation. With the spicy ghatti chutney, that is made of hurukadale, roasted Bengal gram, coconut and  the idli takes on a bold, flavourful avatar. Pour the \u2018telu\u2019 or \u2018flowy\u2019 mint-coconut chutney over the idli to make for a bite that melts in the mouth.\nRs. 34 (usd 0.45) for 2 idlis \n \nUddina Vade\nIt\u2019s a tough act for the vade to follow the idli in takeaway mode, given that the vade is best savoured hot and crispy. However, a saving grace here is the vade is studded with curry leaves, green chillies, peppercorns, fresh coconut, thereby making for a flavourful bite. Soak up the past-warm vade with the chutney to relish the warming heat from the green chillies in the chutney. \nRs. 25 (usd 0.3) per vade\n\nKhara Bath\nBCB\u2019s khara bath is a flavourful one, embellished with curry leaves, toasted lentils, mustard seeds, grated coconut, coriander, tasty enough to be savoured sans the chutney. But if you like it spicy, go ahead and introduce it to the zesty gatti chutney. \nRs. 25 (usd 0.3) \n\nKesari Bath\nEnd your takeaway tiffin with the kesari bath! There\u2019s tonnes of ghee that goes into this sweet semolina and vermicelli concoction and you can taste it in its lush richness. The flavours draw from the tangy fruitiness of the pineapple and the warming cloves. The plum raisins add a sugary pop when you bite into one. \nRs. 25 (usd 0.3) \n\nNote: I haven\u2019t rated these as I feel it would be unfair to rate South Indian breakfast items in a takeaway format. Since this is a rerun episode, prices of the dishes may have changed since.\n\nBrahmins\u2019 Coffee Bar is open only in the mornings from 6am to 1030am presently.\nADDRESS -  Near Shankar Mutt, Ranga Rao Rd, Shankarapura, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560004; tel +91 98450 30234\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/bZat92ZaSkeRCVyJA\n\nBrahmins\u2019 Coffee Bar Previous Video Link: https://youtu.be/3tvWL9eJQRM\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

Rava Idli, Masala Dosa |  Rerun Episode", "description": "#mtr #vegetarian #supportlocal\n\nsupport local eateries, takeaway, mtr, mavalli tiffin rooms, lalbagh, vegetarian lunch, thaali, rava idli, masala dosa, hema malini maiya, bangalore, bengaluru\n\nStep into Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, the city\u2019s oldest eatery, In this throwback episode to see how they have evolved their popular 21-item traditional lunch to a more convenient and packaging-friendly 9-dish mini-meal. \n\nFrom revamped, sanitised processes to consolidated menus, this century-old institution is revamping and reworking processes to meet the needs of the current situation. But then, that shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, because after all, they do have a tradition of innovating through adversities in the past, as illustrated in the invention of the rava idli during the rice famine of the 40s, or the seed for MTR packaged foods that was sown during the 1975-77 emergency. \n\nNote: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.\n\nMini Meals\nNo longer the enormous spread that would be a delicious gateway to a post-lunch slumber, the mini meals is compact in its post-covid avatar. But that doesnt get in the way of making for a satisfying lunch, puri, saagu, rice, rasam, palya, mosaru anna, poppadom, uppinakayi and payasam, the mini meal has all that you need to savour a taste of Mavalli Tiffin Room. \nRs. 162 (usd 2.1) \n8/10\n\nMasala Dose\nAlthough packed in a foil-lined box, the masala dose is missing its crunch in takeaway mode, understandably, as opposed to when savoured at the restaurant. You can heat it on a tava with a dollop of ghee to make some amends, and the flavours are trademark MTR, the sprightly chutney smeared inside the dosa and the flavourful, bright aloogadde palya. The chutney is rich in coconut and green chilli spice. All in all, makes for a delicious takeaway dose, once you get past the expectation of eating something crisp.   \nRs. 90 (usd 1.2)\n\nRava Idli\nA dish born of a crisis, the rava idli is said to have been invented in the kitchens of Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, when there was a shortage of rice during the famine of the 40s. This is a flavourful rava idli that is rich in yoghurt, embellished with coriander, mint, coconut and topped with toasted cashew, and does spectacularly well as a takeaway. The aloogadde sagu serves well to moisten the idli with its savoury character. \nRs. 60 (usd 0.8)\n\nADDRESS -  Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, #14, Lal Bagh Main Rd, Doddamavalli, Sudhama Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560027; tel +91 80 2222 0022\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/546tf138essAZYnT7\nTakeaway available at all MTR outlets.\n\nPrevious video links:\nMOST POPULAR Bangalore BREAKFAST At MAVALLI TIFFIN ROOMS https://youtu.be/L-knGepV3UE\nExploring Traditions & Tasting the VEGETARIAN LUNCH THALI At Mavalli Tiffin Rooms https://youtu.be/awWIK8PuGR0 \n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

However the current scenario calls for an entirely new approach in food service, and in keeping with this, this revered South Bengaluru eatery has embraced takeaway as a new way of life, at least for the foreseeable future. I visit Vidyarthi Bhavan to document this change from the past and see for myself how its management is taking all steps necessary to ensure continuity of its delicious culinary traditions in as safe a manner as possible. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!\nNote: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.\n\n\nMasala Dosa\nThe masala dose is now folded twice as opposed to the VB classic one fold, an allowance that the eatery has made for the dose to be rolled into an aluminium foil in order to retain its temperature when savoured at home. The crispy crackle of the dose is now replaced by a whisper of a crunch, but the buttery flavours are still spot on. The dose oozes ghee, and the aloogadde palya is mildly seasoned and creamy. It helps to crispen the dose a bit on the pan just before eating. \nRs. 50 (usd 0.7) \n\nIdli\nVB\u2019s idlis are the grainy sort, perfect for ladling over chutney and piping hot sambar, before breaking it down to a delicious, spicy mash. If they\u2019re too cold by the time they get to you, steam for a couple of minutes.\nRs. 26 (usd 0.3) \n\nUddin Vade\nThe vade definitely suffers the most casualty when consumed in a takeaway format. Gone is its crisp crunch, that would yield to a porous bite. The only way to redeem the vada is to dunk it into a bowl of piping hot sambar and savour it with a dollop of spicy chutney.\nRs. 26 (usd 0.3) \n\nKhara Bath\nThe kharabath travels extremely well, given its moist texture. This tasty dish is studded with onions, fried lentils, coconut flakes and curry leaves, making for a playful medley of flavours and textures.\nRs. 26 (usd 0.3) \n\nKesari Bath\nEnd your meal with this luscious semolina preparation, the flavour of the pineapple and cloves is quite pronounced. The dish is mellow in its sweetness, save for the pop of extra sweetness when you bite into a toasted raisin.\nRs. 26 (usd 0.3) \n\nNote: Due to the current uncertain situation, please call the eatery to ascertain the timings and what is available. Prices may have changed since when this episode was originally published a year ago.\n\nVidyarthi Bhavan has also launched a contactless ordering system, send a whatsapp message \u2018Hi\u2019 to +919164926465\n\nADDRESS -  32, Gandhi Bazaar Main Rd, Gandhi Bazaar, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560004; tel +91 80 2667 7588\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/FE1myFwkzEFkUAJm7\n\nLinks to previous Vidyarthi Bhavan videos\nThe Perfect South Indian Breakfast At VIDYARTHI BHAVAN | Bengaluru\u2019s Iconic MASALA DOSA & TIFFIN https://youtu.be/nfSu_Pp4MZ4\n\nSavouring Our FIRST CRISP MASALA DOSA In The New Normal | VIDYARTHI BHAVAN, BANGALORE | Rava Vada\u2026 https://youtu.be/Ap9nhsJEsLQ\n\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV.

The pandemic had quite literally taken the wind out of their enterprise, a tiny 3-table eatery in a nook of South Bengaluru where Mr. Mohammed and his son would sell the biryani made by his wife at home. However, the sincerity with which this affectionate couple shared the making of the biryani in our video seems to have won for Noon\u2019s Biryani legions of fans resulting in a new lease of life for this neighbourhood shop that now has customers across India, with requests from overseas patrons too for their special biryani spice blend. I caught up with them for a quick chat a few weeks ago when I popped into their store to take away some biryani, and also left with a healthy dollop of inspiration based on what the family had managed to achieve notwithstanding the current challenges of life. I hope you enjoy this impromptu inspiring vlog, take care, stay safe and happy eating.\n\nif possible, please spare a thought for the many neighbourhood restaurants and eateries that have given us abundant culinary pleasures and now depend on our support to make it through these gloomy days, one small takeaway order at a time. \n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nTIMINGS: lunch - 1pm to 4pm; dinner - 630pm to 10pm\nNote: Closed on Mondays; they make the mutton biryani only on weekends.

In this throwback takeaway biryani review, we visited Meghana Foods, a establishment that seems to have a formidable following for its biryanis that are mostly made in the Hyderabadi style with loads of masala. Purists may balk at the eatery\u2019s top seller, a boneless chicken biryani that to me seemed like a culinary intersection of Sino-Indian and Hyderabadi fare! Love it or hate it, you certainly can\u2019t ignore Meghana Foods!\n\nAnd to allay consumer fears in a covid world, they seem to be following many of the practices - temperature checks, hand sanitation, sealed takeaway packs, etc. - that will have to be the norm when it comes to eating out. Hope you enjoy this one, take care and stay safe.\n\nNote: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support local eateries.\n\nSpecial Veg Biryani\nA biryani that panders to a vegetarian\u2019s biryani craving. The rice is flavourful, and the side of tossed vegetables draws clever inspiration from a mirchi ka salan in its flavours. \nRs. 230 (usd 3) \n8/10\n\nAloo Dum Biryani\nThe potatoes are fried to a delicious brown and have absorbed the flavourful character of the fried onions and the spices. With the mildly spiced biryani rice, it makes for a tasty combination.\nRs. 214 (usd 2.8) \n7.5/10\n\nChicken Biryani\nA biryani that is made in the traditional Hyderabadi style with loads of masala, this is the biryani to try here. The meat is juicy, moist and flavourful, cooked perfectly to the bone.\nRs. 242 (usd 3.2) \n8.5/10\n\nChicken Boneless Biryani\nTender morsels of boneless meat, tossed in a spicy batter are served as an accompaniment to fluffy grains of biryani rice. Though a dish that is far removed from a traditional Hyderabadi biryani, it still commands legions of fans, I suspect partly because the spicy morsels of meat and generous portion of rice served makes it ideal for sharing. \nRs. 248 (usd 3.3) \n8/10\n\nMutton Biryani\nThe meat was a tad chewy and dry and lacking succulence, the rice though had a nice depth of flavour. Not a biryani that I would order again. \nRs. 301 (usd 4) \n7/10\n\nNote: Due to the current uncertain situation, please call the eatery to ascertain the timings and what is available.

Therefore, as a general rule, the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, raw milk or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods.\nSource: WHO https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200221-sitrep-32-covid-19.pdf\n\nFood containers and packaging. There's no evidence of anyone contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 after touching food containers and food packaging. Many restaurants are now offering no-contact takeout and delivery to lessen the risk of transmission.\n\nStill, if you're concerned, it's reasonable to follow general food safety guidelines. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water after handling takeout containers, and then transfer food to a clean dish using clean utensils. Wash your hands again before eating. After disposing of containers, clean and disinfect any surfaces that had takeout containers on them.\nSource: Mayo Clinic, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/expert-answers/can-coronavirus-spread-food-water/faq-20485479\nFood Standards Australia & New Zealand, https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/safety/Pages/Can-COVID-19-be-transmitted-by-food-or-food-packaging.aspx\n\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease spreading from person to person.

An optimist though, he and his sons prepare to do what it takes to tide this South Canara vegetarian eatery through. Inspiration aside, I also take away a simple but nourishing anna-saaru meal in addition to some of their popular tiffins and sweets. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care, stay safe and happy eating.\nNote: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support the eatery and others like this establishment that need help in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.\n\nSet Dose\nThere\u2019s a hint of tart sweetness in these soft, fluffy dose that are perfectly suited for takeaway. With the nourishing sambar, vegetable saagu and chutney, it makes for a wholesome light meal. \nRs. 48 (usd 0.6) \n\nThatte Idli\nSoft and porous, the thatte idli breaks under its own weight. The sambar, pleasing to the palate with its sweet acidity is perfectly suited to impregnate the idli with its mildly spicy fervour. \nRs. 29 (usd 0.4) \n\nKhara Bath\nAs you place the khara bath in your mouth, the savoury aroma of the onion is what you taste first, followed by the moist crunch of the tomato and the grainy bite of fresh coconut. Spice things up with the chutney. \nRs. 25 (usd 0.3) \n\nKesari Bath\nRedolent in the flavour of cloves, this isn't a kesari bath that\u2019s dripping in ghee. Which makes for a tasty indulgence minus the guilt.\nRs. 27 (usd 0.4) \n\nAnna Sambar\nA sambar rich in lentils and grated coconut, made well, the vegetable, ladies finger, still has its crunch intact. \nRs. 43 (usd 0.6) \n\nAnna Saaru\nThe tomato plays a dual role in this pleasing South Canara tilli saaru, more popularly known as tomato rasama here in Bengaluru. The tomatoes are the foundation of this tart broth, and also offer a fruity crunch in the diced tomato that is perhaps added when the rasam is near cooked. \nRs. 43 (usd 0.6) \n\nMysore Pak\nRich in ghee, the fresh mysore pak crumbles under its own weight. When you place it in the mouth, it dissolves into a lush, buttery pool of deliciousness.\nRs. 18 (usd ) per piece \n\nJehangir\nCrisp, crunch and moist, this well-made old-fashioned mithai is a popular sweet at NMH.\nRs. 18 (usd ) per piece \n\nNote: Due to the current uncertain situation, please call the eatery to ascertain the timings and what is available.

And spearheading this unique \u2018nostalgic\u2019 culinary initiative is Chef Regi Mathew, who has spent more than a decade extensively touring his home state, exploring recipes and connecting with cooks across homes, community kitchens, and even toddy shops. The resulting food is a labour of love, with ingredients sourced from micro-regions in Kerala to match the provenance of the dish, for instance the rice for the fabled Ramassery Idli comes from Palakkad, the home of the idli, the karimeen (pearl spot fish) from Vaikom, Kottayam, and so on\u2026 This fastidious approach to sourcing also seems to extend to the kitchen hands at KCK too, who hail from traditional kitchens and homes in \u2018God\u2019s own country\u2019. In this episode, I partake of a lavish lunch that spans across a dozen preparations, made possible by their innovative menu approach that allows for diners to savour a string of delicacies in the course of a meal. Hope you enjoy this one, take care, stay safe and happy eating!\n\nNote:\nThe set menus at Kappa Chakka Kandhari are priced upwards of Rs. 475 (usd 6.5) and in addition to a tasting of seven preparations, include a beverage and dessert too. Additional add-ons (limited servings), kappa vada, koorka fry, ramassery idli with chicken curry, are priced at Rs. 100 (usd 1.4) per dish.  \n\nRajayogi Meal\nA set menu that\u2019s fit for a king, this smorgasbord of a dozen dishes is sheer indulgence! Begin with juicy prawns in a coconut-kokum masala that is steamed in a petite banana leaf pouch, spicy \u2018touchings\u2019 of needle fish, the plumpest soft shell crabs, and a delicately flavoured pearl spot fish draped in a robust, toddy shop masala, amongst other delicacies that include a peppery chicken peralan and a slow-cooked mutton coconut fry. After an interlude of a sweet, sour and spicy, pineapple-nendram relish, the main courses troop out - pidi, tiny rice dumplings steeped in coconut milk and served with a flavourful simple chicken curry, a velvety mutton stew and appam combo, and a prawn puttu biryani that hits the spot. For dessert, there\u2019s much to choose from, we tried the chilli-pricking kandhari ice cream and the luscious tender-coconut cloud pudding.\nRs. 1475 (usd 20.3)       \n9/10 (overall) The pearl spot fry, mutton fry, soft shell crab, pineapple nendram relish, mutton fry, appam and stew  - 10/10\n\nKappa Vada\nRs. 100 (usd 1.4) add-on serving\n8/10\n\nKoorka Fry \nRs. 100 (usd 1.4) add-on serving\n8/10\n\nRamassery Idli With Varutharacha Chicken Curry & Sambar\nThe idli is aromatic and soft, slightly pasty, and has a bit of a weight that lends to combining with the sambar or spicy chicken curry.  \nRs. 100 (usd 1.4) add-on serving\n9/10\n\nAyakora Nellikai Masala Fry\nA fish fry inspired by frugal tribal traditions, the fish is spiced with a paste of sun-dried gooseberries, green peppercorn and kandhari, bird\u2019s eye chilli.

Not just a generic version as dished out by fast food chains! Instead, he dug deep into his experience as a culinary student in Southern Italy, to open a pizzeria serving Sicilian style pizzas in his erstwhile North Bengaluru caf\u00e9 in Yelahanka New Town. Siddy\u2019s Pizza, as I discovered during a leisurely visit, is a one-man passion enterprise, where Siddy, as Siddhanth is known, does everything from taking the order to putting together the pizzas to serving customers who quite often chat with him as the cheese-laden flavourful pies bake in the oven. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and happy eating!\n\nGarlic Butter Bread\nPillowy soft and gushing with garlic-infused buttery flavour; the butter is molten as the bread comes out of the oven!

The cheese and tomato sauce play second fiddle to the meat and onions. If you love smoked chicken, this pie is a must-have!\nRs. 420 (usd 5.8)\n10/10\n\nClassic Pepperoni & Cheese - Large\nLush in virgin olive oil, this is a classic Sicilian style pizza, its \u2018bready\u2019 texture quite similar to a focaccia. There\u2019s plenty of mozzarella that sits atop the pizza, followed by the spicy sauce and onions. But it is the fat-laden savoury fervour of the pepperoni that is the hero of this pizza!

I visited this modest eatery set in the ground floor of their home in the suburb of Brookefield, where I not only savoured a delicious Andhra Bhojanam but also caught the making of an iconic Nellore Chepala Pulusu, a sour and spicy fish curry. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and happy eating. \n\nPlate Rice Meals\nServed on a banana leaf tray, the rice meals is a simple but satisfying affair that consists of two vegetables, one dry and the other moist, a sambar, rasam and a nourishingly tasty pappu to keep company with the anam (steamed rice) and flavoured rice. There is also a sweet to round off the meal.\nRs. 99 (usd 1.4)\n8/10 \n\nChepala Pulusu (Sour and Spicy Fish Curry)\nMade by his wife, Vijayalakshmi, to a recipe that goes back to Sasidhar Reddy\u2019s grandmother, the Chepala Pulusu is a must-try here.

The result is a unique taste that\u2019s fiery at first but also the sort that endears itself once you get past the \u2018suffering\u2019!

The stall would travel from village fair to village fair selling mithai and khaara made of pure country ghee. 72 years on, village ghee may no longer be easily available, but Suresh Chikkananjundappa, his grandson, tends to the traditions of his ancestors in the ghee sweets and savouries that he personally prepares with his family and dedicated workers. Their mysore pak is hugely popular, made to a special technique where the gram flour is lightly roasted with some ghee, before finding its way into the paaka or sugar mixture. However, the tuppa jilebi, with the batter fermented overnight in clay pots, the rich badam halwa made with homemade khoa, and a seriously addictive red rice avalakki mixture, all made with pure ghee, are also must-haves when at this tiny sweet shop. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and happy eating!\n\nTuppa Jilebi\nMade of a batter that is fermented overnight in a clay pot, and fried in pure ghee, the result is a white jilebi that crackles with a sticky bite and unburdens its ghee-laden sweetness with just a tinge of sourness. \nRs. 440 (usd 6) per kilo \n9/10 \n\nTuppa Avalakki\nRed rice puffed to a crisp in a bath of boiling ghee, comes together with ghee-roasted cashewnuts, curry leaves, Bengal gram and generous sprinkling of spices to make a seriously addictive khaara or mixture.  \nRs. 560 (usd 7.7) per kilo \n9/10 \n\nMysore Pak\nSoft and crumbly, lush with ghee, this is the sort of Mysore Pak that dissolves on the palate with the light lilt of cardamom, when fresh. You can taste the weight of the gram flour, especially in the tiny clumps that have held on to the ghee as the gram flour is lightly roasted before it finds its way into the sugar syrup or paaka. The hero ingredient in this mithai though is the ghee that makes it Sri Chikkaveerana\u2019s most popular mithai for over seven decades.\nRs. 560 (usd 7.7) per kilo \n10/10 \n\nBene Murukku\nOne of the few items here that is made in oil, the murukku though crunchy and flavourful with cumin and carom seeds and the nuttiness of sesame, feels a bit spartan when tasted in the company of the other heavyweights here.\nRs. 280 (usd 3.8) per kilo \n8/10 \n\nBadam Halwa\nGarnished with chironji seeds and slivers of pistachio and almonds, the halwa is rich with the reduced milk solid, ghee and the grainy bite of coarsely ground almonds. Although, the Mysore Pak is traditionally more popular here, the badam halwa comes a close second. \nRs. 640 (usd 8.7) per kilo \n9.5/10 \n\n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nTIMINGS: 1030am to 9pm \nNote: They have no branches, to taste what I tasted, visit the original shop located in Vijayapura town by following the google coordinates given below.

Her love for cooking led her to open a tiny eatery at home with two tables only, catering initially to college students yearning for home-cooked meals. Entirely self-taught, Mrs. Khanum serves up a repertoire of Hyderabadi-Mughlai dishes, assisted by her husband and children. A meal here is not just about delicious sustenance but also about the warming hospitality with which one is welcomed and served, as I discovered when I dropped into Royal Mess late one evening. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and happy eating!\n\nMutton Kheema\nThe mutton kheema is coarse and grainy, cooked with meat on the bone, that results in a deep-flavoured, warming dish. The sort that makes it a must-try here.\nRs. 350 (usd 4.8) for a large portion.\n9/10\n\nMutton Masala\nFlavoured with the gentle sweet flavours of fresh tomato and the savouriness of onions, the masala is tasty.

The biryani had cooled down a bit, rendering the rice slightly dry and the meat a fibrous bite.

It is the meat of an indigenous variety of sheep that hails from Bandur, a village located between Malavalli and Bannur near Mysuru. Prized for its juicy tender meat, the sheep was traditionally sold in village shanties in Bannur, ergo the acquired moniker, Bannur. I drove to Bannur to learn more about this sheep and also catch a mutton meal at a family eatery, Bannur Ramaswami Military Hotel, that showcases this very special meat in its homestyle preparations.

His fondness for food and his ability to recall the flavour of dishes from local eateries led him to set up a pushcart on the outskirts of Bengaluru, serving a self-taught village-style biryani. In the beginning, \u201cthings were difficult, sometimes humiliating and marked by periods of self-doubt\u201d, recalls Raju, as he is popularly known. Giving up though wasn\u2019t an option, driven also by the necessity to provide for his family. Slowly, the popularity of his mild-flavoured biryani served in cups of dried banana leaves, jonne, grew, and so did the scale of his enterprise. Today, this resilient entrepreneur\u2019s Halli Jonne Biryani occupies prime real estate in Jayanagar, South Bengaluru, and is frequented by over 500 customers on any given day.

Tasting BANGARPET CHAAT At Ramesh Chit Chat In Bangarapet", "description": "#chaat #bangarapet #karnataka\n\nbangarpet chaat, chaat innovation, white paani, vegetarian, white paani puri, pani puri, masala puri, sev puri, bangarpet tikki, pot gulkand salad, pizza paani puri, street food, pani puri, bangarapet, kolar district, kolar gold fields, kgf, karnataka\n\nSon of R. Panduranga Setty, who is said to have begun the Bangarpet Chaat tradition in 1974 in Bangarapet, named so (Bangar = gold, pete = town) for its importance as a town that connected the erstwhile Kolar gold fields to Bengaluru, 80 kilometres away, young Ramesh, wasn\u2019t happy just continuing with the family legacy. A desire to create something new led to the invention of the \u2018white paani\u2019, a clear liquid that though as innocuous-looking as water, packs a potent, spicy punch. And thus began the tradition of the Bangarpet Paani Puri, that has spawned a few hundred namesakes in Karnataka. Ramesh however continues to operate out of his tiny shop in a bylane in Bangarapet, serving customers personally and experimenting constantly to add to his spicy, tangy repertoire. I spend an evening with him, tasting his wares, and return impressed with his childlike enthusiasm that doesn\u2019t seem to have waned in the least despite being in the business for nearly four decades, his latest creation, a pizza inspired paani puri! Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\n\nWhite Paani Puri\nA simple assemblage of green peas, onions, carrots and coriander, stuffed in a semolina and flour puri, topped with the potent \u2018white paani\u2019. The spiciness of paani though is toned down by the creaminess of the peas and the crunch of the onions. A simple, clean flavoured paani puri that allows one to appreciate every component singularly, as well as in its completeness. \nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\n8.5/10\n\nSpecial Dahi Puri\nEmbellished with rose petals, this chaat is a riot of flavours and textures. The crispiness of the chaat components and the spice of the masala play second fiddle to the creamy, sweet richness of the yoghurt that is fortified with Horlicks, milk powder and sugar. \nRs. 50 (usd 0.7)\n10/10\n\nFloating Paani Puri\nThe floating paani puri is a spicy affair, the spicy white paani goes into the puri and also floats the puri. The moist crispness of the puri is endearing as is the crunch of the spiced peanuts and the sev, despite the fresh crunch of the onion, cucumber and tomato, there is no getting away from the chilli heat of the sea of white paani. \nRs. 40 (usd 0.6)\n9.5/10\n\nTikki Masala Bangarpet\nA take on the Bengaluru masala puri, this is puri topped with spicy chutney, sweet chutney, peas, garam masala, squeeze of lime, onions, carrots, coriander, sev and puffed rice. It has all the components that you would expect to find in a chaat without being overdressed! \nRs. 30 (usd 0.4)\n8.5/10\n\nSpecial Sev Puri\nThe flat papdi base for this chaat is fried in ghee which gives it a rich, \u2018biscuity\u2019 bite embellished with the nuttiness of sesame seeds. You can taste the edge of garlic in the chutney that the fresh ingredients are tossed in. \nRs. 50 (usd 0.7)\n9/10\n\nBhelpuri\nA typical bhel but with the addition of the peas gravy that goes into every plat of chaat here, I found this rendered the puffed rice soggy and that didn\u2019t quite work for me.\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\n7/10\n\nPizza Paani Puri\nI doff my hat to Ramesh on his latest attempt to innovate and bring a foreign flavour to the bylanes of Bangarapet.

Facing financial difficulty, a chance encounter with a visiting relative at an exhibition who was looking for food to be catered led to the couple setting up a home-cooked meal enterprise. A family-run operation, they would shop, cook and deliver the food themselves, with their children lending a hand with the chores too.  However, work from home and the current situation bought their livelihood to a standstill yet again! Not one to give up though, this family has set-up a small one-table eatery in the east Bengaluru neighbourhood of Kaggadasapura, primarily to serve as a takeaway point for their delicious home-cooked Rajasthani fare, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I drive here to chat with the couple, watch them cook a laal maas, sev tamatar and other dishes, before tucking into a delicious meal coupled with the warm hospitality of this Rajput family that has an inspiring, never-give-up attitude.

When they found none, she decided to quit her job and set up a small eatery that would endeavour to dish out the flavours of their favourite chola bhatura from Delhi. And so seasoned cooks were hired from Delhi, a complex 58-spice masala developed to ensure authenticity of taste, the right size of chickpea sourced to convey the flavour of the spices, et al. Barely had this enterprise found its feet early last year when covid struck! I made a surprise visit to Gopaljee Caf\u00e9 one afternoon in response to a plea from the eatery. Suffice to say my conversation with this passionate lady entrepreneur and tasting of the puffy bhature and \u2018mazedaar\u2019 chole compelled us to return to film an episode of Gourmet On The Road.

Stay safe and happy eating!  \n\nChole Bhature\nThe bhatura is light and puffy yet with a bit of strength, to match the tenacity of the 56-spice blend masala that is delicately warming yet has enough depth to linger on the palate. The chickpeas, cocooned in the flavour of the masala, a seasoning of oil, chilli and spices, are stained deep brown by some amla and cooked such that they retain their shape yet yield in a creamy texture to the bite. The mandatory topping of dry, spiced aloo (potatoes) adds a slightly tangy flavour to the dish. If you like it spicy, go for generous bites of the green chilli pickle in between mouthfuls of the chole bhature. If you like paneer, opt for the paneer chole bhature, which arrives with a paneer and coriander mince, stuffed into the bhaturas, and also atop the chole.\nRs. 100 (usd 1.4) per plate, plain \nRs. 125 (usd 1.7) per plate, with paneer\n9/10\n\nLassi\nThe lassi is thick and creamy, garnished with nuts, and also provides cooling respite if you have ingested more of the green chilli than you can handle.\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7) \n8/10\n\nGulab Jamun\nThe way to end your meal if you have a sweet tooth is with their perfectly browned gulab jamuns.\nRs. 60 (usd 0.8) for two pieces\n8/10 \n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nTIMINGS: 9am to 9pm\nNote: The chole bhature are served between 9am and 830pm; the bhaturas are fried fresh upon order, so it may involve a bit of a wait especially if crowded.\nADDRESS -  Gopaljee Caf\u00e9, 17/1,chandra mansion, Marathahalli - Sarjapur Rd, Bellandur, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560102; tel: +91 90350 03283/ 91081 71715\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/9DLhEGH91svQpPWc6\n\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

Shortly after getting married, they gave up their MNC jobs and their eatery, Jagli Tindi was born, in a tiny nook in Kengeri, on the outskirts of Bengaluru, with a menu comprising mostly dishes gleaned from their grandma\u2019s recipes, with ingredients sourced from Kundapura to lend authenticity to the taste. Two years on, this passion enterprise has moved to a slightly larger space in Banashankari, South Bengaluru, but the couple still remain hands-on, Suhas, in the kitchen, and Raksha managing the front of the house. I visit them to learn of their inspiring story, catch some of the action in the kitchen, before sitting down to a slightly indulgent tiffin session. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!\n \nMandakki Upakari\nMade with a red puffed rice that\u2019s tossed with their \u2018secret\u2019 podi mix and onions, topped with grated coconut and plenty of peanuts.

There\u2019s a hint of tartness from the fermentation, the red tomato chutney makes for a sprightly partner to the gentle flavoured kadubu, with its tangy, slightly spice, sour and nutty character. The vegetable sagu adds to the nutritional quotient of this tasty tiffin.\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\n9/10\n\nJagli Masala Dosa\nThis creation of Suhas Karanth seems to be inspired by the 99-variety dosa ilk. The dosa is smeared with a paste of potatoes, spicy podi and ghee, as it is roasted to a crisp on the tava. Folded, flattened and cut into two, this dosa creation makes for an interesting snack if you are the sort who is acquiesce to pushing the envelope for what a masala dosa can be.   \nRs. 58 (usd 0.8)\n8.5/10\n\nKolkatte\nSteamed in a banana leaf, this steamed dumpling of urad dal batter, is stained lightly with the colour of the leaf. Slightly pasty and dense in its texture, and studded with whole peppercorns that lend their tingling touch. Whilst the red chutney adds zing, next time, I would also ask for some of the nutritious vegetable saagu to complement the austerity of this steamed dumpling.\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\n8.5/10\n\nBanana Kesari Bath\nThe ripe banana heroes this velvety-textured dish from the start to finish, definitely order a plate of this to close your tindi experience here.\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\n9/10\n\nCoffee\nRs. 10 (usd 0.1)\n8/10\n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nTIMINGS: 7am to 9pm\nNote: This is a relatively young enterprise, please support them with your patience in case of a delay because of the response from this video.

Like this delicious lunch that we savoured at  this popular eatery in Hassan, 210 kms from Bengaluru, a couple of months ago. Guided by suggestions from our viewers, I didn't quite know what to expect when I walked into a bustling lunch session here late one afternoon on our way back from Mangalore. But the memory of the rustic, homestyle Gowda dishes that I tasted here, lingers to this day. Suffice to say I would happily make the 210 km drive to Mamatha Hotel in a heartbeat just to savour the food all over again. Hope you enjoy the episode. I take this opportunity to wish you and your family a fabulous 2021. Take care and stay safe.\n\nKatla Fry\nCoated in a delicious spiced batter that complements the earth flavours of the freshwater fish, the katla fry is a popular dish here for all the right reasons.

Makes for a great accompaniment to the ragi mudde and steamed rice.\nRs. 170 (usd 2.3) \n9/10\n\nMutton Biryani\nFlecks of fat abound in this biryani, that is redolent with the aroma of mint and coriander, and do well to coat the zesty, hard-spice laced rice with its unctuousness.

This meant foregoing a substantial chunk of revenues and relying on takeaway business only, but this was something they were prepared to live with, for the safety of their customers and staff. So when they reopened the eatery to customers a couple of weeks ago, we lost no time in getting there to savour their hugely popular donne biryani and also report on the current experience at this 90-year old culinary institution that has a reputation for being jam packed with customers. We arrived to find certain measures in place, even though in precarious danger of being overrun by its patrons.

Legend has it that he would treat each customer as a guest visiting his home and leave no stone unturned in feeding them. Tales of his legendary hospitality and traditional fare soon spread far and wide and this tiny eatery evolved into the legendary Subbaiah Gari chain of restaurants.

You begin with tantalising sweets like annavaram prasadam, poornam boorelu, junnu, savoury fries like the tamalapaku (betel leaf) bajji, garelu, before moving on to the procession of curries, lentils, tantalising rice preparations like the pullihora (tamarind rice), panasa (raw jackfruit) mukkala biryani and chutneys. The list of dishes served is far too long to be contained within this description, but suffice to say the food prepared by the master cooks who have trained in the original Kakinada Subbayya Gaari Hotel will hold your attention. But then, this is also the sort of meal that you need to savour at leisure, in order to do full justice to the dishes that are served with generous dollops of neyi (ghee) and old-fashioned hospitality. \nRs. 250 (usd 3.4)\n9/10\n\n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nTIMINGS: Lunch - 11am to 4pm; Dinner - 7pm to 10pm \nNote: Note: Subbaiah Gari also serves their famous Butta Bhojanam, a takeaway meal bundle that will feed 4 to 6 diners for Rs. 400.

The result is Northwest Kebab & Curryhouse, a breezy casual dining restaurant in Koramangala, that is showcasing an interesting repertoire of dishes from the North West Frontier region. Barely a couple of weeks old, and with not too many customers at present, this is certainly an eatery to pencil into your eating-out plans if you are looking to taste \u201cNorth Indian-style\u201d of food that goes beyond the ubiquitous palak paneer and butter chicken!

And when temple fare is presented in a culinary experience that is not only rich in its depth of traditions, but also celebrates diversity to appeal to all humanity, it is elevated to food that truly satisfies the soul. In a first on Gourmet On The Road, I experience the philosophy and flavours of Sattvic cuisine at The Higher Taste, a fine dining restaurant located in the serene environment of ISKCON Temple, Bengaluru. This isn\u2019t a typical episode, but then the experience too isn't!

The year was 1992 and his hometown was Hoskote, then a mere highway halt enroute to Madras. Soon Mani began preparing and serving a rustic-style mutton \u2018biryani\u2019 inspired by his amma\u2019s recipe. His early patrons, workers from nearby factories, truckers and drivers, for whom the biryani was a satisfying early morning meal to help sustain them through the day, having relished Mani\u2019s biryani not only carried its taste but also news on this biryani shop. Year after year, the throng of customers to Mani\u2019s eatery grew, and this also spawned the tradition of the early morning Hoskote biryani ritual with other biryani shops opening in its wake. Today Mani Dum Biryani Hoskote caters to hundreds of customers every Tuesday, Friday, and a few thousand on Sundays, but the rustic soul of the biryani remains, be it in the setting or the flavour of the dish, prepared only by Mani\u2019s sons with a secret spice blend made by his wife. I drove out at dawn one Tuesday to watch the sons, Manjunath, Kiran Kumar and Chandrashekar prepare the biryani that first put Hoskote on the food lovers\u2019 map. \n\nMutton Biryani\nThe only dish made at Mani Dum Biryani, is unique in its aroma that is redolent of an amalgam of spices combined with meat. Each grain of the rice has absorbed the procession of spices that go into the pot and the fat that is rendered from the meat, this is the sort of biryani that leaves behind a spicy impression on the palate. You can taste the heat of green chillies, and the flavour of the secret spice mix that\u2019s made in Mani\u2019s home. Some of the meat is laced with fat that melts in the warmth of one\u2019s mouth, some pieces though can have a bit of a bite. This is a spicy biryani, and the mosaru bhajji, onion and cucumber raitha helps cool things down.\nRs. 230 (usd 3.1)\n9/10\n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nTIMINGS: 6am to 930am on Tuesday, Friday and Sundays only.

But because cool drinks and ice creams weren\u2019t popular in this sleepy South Canara town those days, the Pai family decided to diversify into snacks. Their first creation, a vegetable cutlet, then a foreign item to the Udupi populace, took nearly five years to curry favour with the locals.

And because it was prepared in a \u2018gadibidi\u2019 (kannada word for \u2018hurry\u2019) it came to be known as the Gadbad.

I visit this eatery that has the vibe of a busy dining hall to indulge in a humongous meal, and along the way also catch up with its unassuming owner, Vicky Pai, who says his trying experiences as a young executive looking for affordable, homestyle food in a new city, spurred him to open Machali - to serve tasty, homestyle food at affordable prices. And going by my meals at this eatery, I have visited thrice already, and watching fastidious Mangalorans relish the seafood here, Machali certainly delivers, whether one wants to enjoy a sumptuous fish meal and fry for Rs. 150 or splurge Rs. 300. Truly, a democratic seafood restaurant that caters to all.\n\nFish Thaali\nA standard Mangalore fish meal experience, on the plate there is a fish curry with a small piece of fish, some dry vegetables on the side, boiled rice, shrimp chutney, fried sandige and pickle. Servers walk along ladling more fish curry, a simple Konkani style lentil preparation, daali thove, and rasam out of buckets. \nRs. 60 (usd 0.8)\n8/10\n\nTaru Buthai\nTiny sardines, fried to delicious scrumptiousness, the sort that you eat whole. Quite tasty!\nRs. 100 (usd 1.3)\n8.5/10\n\nPrawn Fry\nA robustly-flavoured fresh prawn preparation crusted in a Konkan koliwada masala. Once you get past the spices, you can taste the sweet lilt of the prawns.\nRs. 230\n8.5/10\n\nBoneless Crab Ghee Roast\nPerfect for those who love crab but don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of de-shelling one. The lush ghee roast masala packs a punch more so against the mild flavours of the crab, the buttery fervour of the ghee brings the spices and the crabmeat together. \nRs. 280 (usd 3.8)\n10/10\n\nSquid Ghee Roast\nThe squid was cooked to the texture that yielded quite gently to the bite, the masala though, seemed a tad salty to my taste. Perhaps a bit lacking in the ghee. \nRs. 180 (usd 2.4) \n7.5/10\n\nAlle Piyao\nA flavourful Konkani curry made of ginger, onions and fresh coconut. The onions, starring both in the masala and the seasoning, are quite pronounced on the palate, as is a tinge of turmeric and the warmth of the ginger.   \nRs. 130 (usd 1.8)\n10/10\n\nAnjal Tava Fry\nA plump piece of fish, flakey and pristine in its freshness, crusted with a punchy masala. You can taste the red chilli spice the moment you place the fish in your mouth, but the meaty character of the anjal balances against the spicy hit.  \nRs. 200 (usd 2.7)\n9/10\n\nPomfret Tava Masala\nThe pomfret is burdened under the weight of a flavourful masala that has notes of savouriness, heat and sourness, owing to the onions, curry leaves, chillies and tamarind. The fish is moist, poached in a turmeric curry first, before being slathered with the masala in a pan. \nRs. 300 (usd 4)\n9/10\n\nHappy Eating!\n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\nGourmet On The Road Mangalore Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLri_37vf6mmqELg4kChPIYLp4EzfLS0lq\n\nTIMINGS: lunch - 1130am to 330pm, dinner - 7pm to 10pm \nNote: Closed for dinner on Mondays.

Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\n\nKaladaka Tea (KT)\nA melange of thick tea decoction layered gently over frothy milk that\u2019s fortified with sugar.

Borrowing a homestyle tradition of cooking dosas on individual tawas, \u201che pioneered\u201d the technique of making a dose that was both roasted and steamed. And thus began the tradition of a scrumptiously delicious, crisp and fluffy breakfast treat, now known as the Mulbagal Dosa, that has put this temple town on the map for every dose aficionado. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe. \n\nSpecial Masala Dosa\nRoasted first and then steamed, the form of the Mulbagal Dosa with its upturned edges mirrors the shape of the individual cast iron pans it is cooked in. Crusty and crisp on the outset, soft and spongy within, this dose comes across as a cross between a traditional version and an appam. Oozing ghee, the dose breaks in a crisp crackle that belies its thick and fluffy body. The chilli-warming, slightly sour notes of the red onion chutney smeared within complements the palya. For a spicier bite, taste the dose with the lentil chutney.  \nRs. 45 (usd 0.6)\n10/10\n\nMasala Vada\nCrisp and flavourful, makes for a tasty sidekick to the dosa.\nRs. 6 (usd 0.1)\n8/10  \n\nSpecial Plain Dosa\nThe unique texture of the dose is heightened because there is none of the potato stuffing (palya) to moisten the dose; taste it before the masala dose to savour completely the texture of this unique creation.\nRs. 40 (usd 0.5)\n9/10\n\nOnion Dosa\nMore like a thick, fluffy uthappam. The hero here is the texture and flavour of the onion; you can taste the near caramelised, sweet notes of the fried onions, and also the moist bite of the translucent onions that haven\u2019t been roasted to a crisp. A dose that can get heavy, the chutneys provide respite. \nRs. 40 (usd 0.5)\n8.5/10\n\nHappy Eating!\n\nKripal Amanna,\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nTIMINGS: Breakfast 730am to 12noon, Evening tiffin 6pm to 8pm\nNote: Get there early, they run out quick, much before closing time, especially on weekends.

Run by second and third generation immigrants who were shipped to India by the British over a century ago, the cuisine in these restaurants had evolved to integrate Indian influences, much like how the entrepreneurs of Chinese descent, now Indian citizens, had adapted to the tastes and traditions of the land. Since then, most of these restaurants have closed doors. However during my recent visit to Mangalore, I came upon one such establishment that has stood the test of time for nearly half a century.

Although spicy, the chilli heat is balanced against the umami flavours of the dish. There are also bits of chicken skin in the dish that provides a lovely flavour burst. \nRs. 220 (usd 3)\n10/10\n\nShin Min Rice\nA one-dish meal of soy prawns, sweet garlic chicken, fried rice topped with an egg sauce that coats every grain of rice in its moist custardy texture.

Their following may have grown over the years, but the eatery remains as basic as it was when they first opened; I asked Balwant why he didn\u2019t have a name board, and he modestly replied, \u201cI thought I would put up a board when I improved the hotel,\u201d meaning the interiors.\n\nHis son, Prashant interrupts to say \u201cwe are on google maps and customers find us so we don\u2019t need a signpost anymore.\u201d And that\u2019s true, it\u2019s the simple yet tasty village style food served in a rustic setting here that\u2019s a big draw for locals and travellers alike and earned for the establishment the moniker, Akki Roti Hotel Anemahal.\n\nAkki Rotti\nThe Malenadu style akki rotties are served hot and puffy with homemade butter that makes for a simple yet delicious accompaniment to the toasty crackle of the rotti.

Their conviction in the dosa, and a dosa cook with credentials apparently in the kitchen of the legendary Vinayaka Mylari, Mysuru, is even stamped in the name of this culinary venture, Malgudi Mylari Mane. I venture out for breakfast one early morning to taste the dose and other meaty offerings here, and return convinced that MMM certainly offers a refreshing change-from-the-usual offering for travellers on this stretch of the road. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating!\n\nMylari Dosa\nTopped with some village butter, the Mylari Dose here served with a herb-enriched green saagu and coconut chutney. Its fluffy, porous texture also makes it a willing accomplice to be dunked in the curries. However, in comparison to the iconic Mysuru Vinayaka Mylari Dose that it seeks to emulate, it doesn\u2019t quite manage the melt-in-the-mouth fragility of the original offering. But it is a tasty dose on its own.\nRs. 40 (usd 0.5)\n8/10\n\nPaaya\nThis broth typically consumed in the morning is the sort that jolts your senses awake with its spicing. Would make for a perfect medium to dunk some hot thatte idlis in here.\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7) soup only; Rs. 100 (usd 1.4) with one trotter\n8/10\n\nKoli Kara\nA Sino-Indian inspired creation of MMM, the chicken is juicy down to the bone. You can taste the heat of the fresh green chillies, the slight sweetness of some tomato sauce and the lingering warmth of red chillies combined with the umami punch of some soy. \nRs. 70 (usd 0.9) per leg piece\n8.5/10\n\nChicken Pepper Fry \nYou can taste the grainy bite of the pepper alongside some garam masala and coriander in this preparation. \nRs. 140 (usd 1.9)\n7.5/10\n\nNaati Koli Fry\nLoved the coriander freshness of this preparation made of free range chicken that is deep in its flavours, fortified also by bits of skin clinging on to the meat. \nRs. 180 (usd 2.4)\n9/10\n\nMutton Fry\nA rustic-style dish, the meat is soft in parts and a tad chewy otherwise. The masala seemed a bit heavy on the salt though, thankfully one could dunk the fluffy dose in to tone it down. \nRs. 200 (usd 2.7)\n7/10\n\nMutton Chops\nThe meat is juicy and pink with a bit of fat, and the sort that peels away from the bone. The curry is thick and flavourful, redolent of coriander and fenugreek.

The meat is moist and juicy, savour it with the rice to taste the complete flavours of this tasty palav.\nRs. 140 (usd 1.9)\n7.5/10\n\nMutton Palav \nAlthough the composition of the spicing is similar to the chicken palav, one can taste the flavour and aroma of the meat in the rice as opposed to the accent of spices in the former.

What makes Sri Shiva Darshana Shashi Thatte Idli Hotel the most popular stop on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway today though is the owning family\u2019s commitment to its culinary legacy over five generations. I stop by for a chat and to taste the idli that in a manner of speaking has put Bidadi on the food lovers\u2019 map.\n\nThatte Idli\nThe thatte idli is pillowy, it is as \u201csoft as air\u201d and breaks under the effect of gravity! Definitely order the butter with the idli, it\u2019s a premium worth paying. The butter seeps through the porous structure of the fragile idli and makes for a bite that melts the moment you place it in your mouth. The chutney delivers a potent chilli punch, the potato saagu is creamy and provides for respite from the spicy yet addictive red chutney. The masala vada makes for a savoury interlude whilst tasting the idli. On the whole, this is an idli that is worth driving 50 kilometres for! \nRs. 50 (usd 0.7) for two idlis, two masala vada.

I catch up with the family in their kitchen where the food is cooked as it was 25 years ago, on an ingeniously designed wood-fired stove. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\n\nPaya Soup\nThe paya is gentle and nourishing with the warming touch of pepper, an appetising start to the meal here.\nRs. 10 (usd 0.1) for a cup of soup; Rs. 180 (usd 2.5) with two trotters\n8/10\n\nFish Kebab\nA fish fry that\u2019s best savoured hot, the flesh is moist with the skin crispened.

Loaded with fresh pepper spice, \nRs. 160 (usd 2.2)\n8.5/10\n\nBoti Fry\nThe boti is cleaned well and cooked with tender hithikabele (peeled hyacinth beans) which helps in toning down some of the \u2018funky\u2019 flavours of the boti.

Absolutely delicious, the meat peels away from the bone, yet has a bit of a bite. There\u2019s bits of fat floating in the gravy, that also adds to the rich, unctuous flavours of the curry.

Cooking in those difficult times led him to mull the idea of setting up a food truck venture for his livelihood. Rustling up a loan from well wishers, he found a second auto that he could afford. Thus began Galli Kitchen, a streetside food enterprise, a far cry from the world of glitz and glamour that Shetty was once used to. Two years on though, Galli Kitchen seems to have changed the fortunes of its owner, and has now upgraded to a full-sized food truck. I catch up with this affable actor over an inspiring chat, and also taste some of the popular fare here.\n\nSabakki Idli\nAn idli that isn't too thick to hold, but weighty nonetheless owing to the sabudana or tapioca pearls. The aroma of the dill takes over the palate when placed in the mouth, the texture is a bit gummy. The idli is the sort that comes alive when combined with the chutneys, especially the spicy and sour notes of the kempu chutney. \nRs. 40 (usd 0.6)\n8.5/10\n9/10 for the kempu chutney\n\nMysore Masala Dose\nShine Shetty\u2019s ode to the 99-variety style of dose that would sustain him during his acting school days in Mumbai. The dose is crisp when it leaves the tava, but weighed down to a soft texture by the loaded stuffing of masala, fresh onions and tomatoes, when gathered into a tight roll. The spicy-sweet flavour of the podi is discernible above the fresh crunch of the veggies. Not a dose for the purist, but a tasty and filling one nonetheless.\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7)\n8/10\n\nNeer Dosa Bela Kai\nThis is how Mangaloreans love to eat their neer dose for breakfast with a lip smacking accompaniment of fresh coconut, jaggery and ghee combined together with a touch of cardamom.

To earn a livelihood, they set up a small eatery in a corner of the city, with absolutely no experience but compelled by necessity and their love for cooking the food of their native land. Despite all odds, their tiny shop, Fish N Dish, prospered modestly over the years. The current situation brought all that to nought as they lost their meagre staff, most of their business, and were forced to fend for themselves to stay afloat.

With his parent\u2019s traditional home as backdrop, his fondness for cooking led to the creation of Thotada Mane, rustic vegetarian dining amidst a verdant garden setting, that seeks to offer not just mere sustenance but also a refreshing glimpse into an alternate way of life. In doing so, he employed an all-women team of housewives from the neighbouring villages, working alongside them in the kitchen to serve up traditional family recipes, some tweaked with playful twists to ensure there is something for everyone who arrives here.

The rotties are \u2018kadak\u2019, crisp around the edges, and loaded with flavour. The akki rotti, infused with onions, dill, green chillies, cumin and more, was my favourite. The spinach rotti is a rice rotti infused with the \u2018dulling\u2019 green notes of spinach, the raagi rotti on the other hand is quite earthy in its flavour. The uchila pudi, with its fibrous nuttiness, tart fervour of tamarind and slight sweetness of jaggery makes for a great combination with the rotties, especially when combined with the yoghurt. And for those with a festish for spicy heat, the mensu will be most appealing!\nRs. 80 (usd 1.1)\nAkki Rotti 9/10; Spinach Rotti 8/10; Raagi Rotti 8/10\n\nMeals\nThe sort of traditional meal you would taste perhaps if you were invited to a home in Srirangapatna.

The vegetables are fresh and crunchy, sourced from the nearby villages, the preparations tasty and comforting in their flavours. The Maddur vade makes for a nice, crisp touch, and the kai obbattu, served for dessert, helps round up this indulgent meal.

In the absence of present day idli steamers, village folk would steam idlis in baskets, known as \u2018chiblus\u2019 in kannada, made of bamboo, over a wood fire. And thus, these soft, aromatic chiblu idlis came into being. The painstaking effort required to steam idlis using this old-fashioned approach has caused this ancient practice to all but disappear. We travel 80 kilometres to Halaguru to savour this delicious tradition at Babu Hotel, a tiny village eatery that has been serving up the chiblu idli for over half a century now. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\n\nChiblu Idli\nThe chiblu idli is aromatic and steaming hot, served with a dollop of butter and alongside palya and red chilli chutney. The idli is soft, porous and carries a tart edge from the fermentation, that the butter helps balance against. The kempu chutney has a good balance of spice, and the crunch of the coconut complements the grainy bite of the hurigadale (roasted gram). The palya is savoury with the flavour of the onions.\nRs. 10 (usd 0.1) per idli; Rs. 5 for butter\n9/10\n\nTuppa Dose/ Bene Dose/ Masala Dose\nThe dose is crisp to the touch and fried to an appealing golden brown.

Bengaluru too has its tiffin rooms and thindi houses that are destinations unto themselves and occupy pride of place in every must-eat-at list. However, unknown to many there are equally worthy eateries that have been serving neighbourhoods quietly for decades. They don\u2019t get celebrated beyond the communities they serve and are quite content with no accolades coming their way. In this episode, I visit one such establishment, SN Refreshments, which has been a cornerstone of JP Nagar, South Bengaluru for its limited but much sought after refreshment fare for 30 years. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\n\nHappy Eating,\nKripal Amanna\nGourmet On The Road,\nFood Lovers TV\n\nIdli\nThe idli is soft, porous and grainy in its texture thanks to the proportion of idli rice and urad dal in the batter, and some rice rava. When dunked into the chutney, the idli readily absorbs much of it, almost falling apart in the process. The chutney is unique, the spicy note of green chilli is accentuated by some jaggery, before submitting to the fresh crunch of the coconut, the bite of the roasted gram and the flavours of the mustard seed-curry leaf oggarane (seasoning). A tasty sambar served alongside is almost glossed over not for any fault of its doing, but because the idli-chutney combination are superstars on their own. When here, enjoy the idli, ladled over with plenty of chutney.  \nRs. 15 per idli\n9/10\n10/10 (for the chutney)\n\nVade\nThe texture of the vade is textbook, crisp to the touch with a lacey crunch on the exterior, yielding and porous on the inside speckled with some green chilli, coriander and curry leaves. fried onions and minimal spicing. Crunchy on its own from the first bite to the last, the vade finds its soulmate in the chutney, its airy texture submitting to the embrace of the condiment. And if  you like a vada dip, the wholesome lentil sambar is happy to acquiesce with its sweet acidity of tomatoes and a whiff of asafoetida.\nRs. 20 per vade\n9.5/10\n\nMasala Dosa \nThe masala dose is roasted to a golden brown with brownish striations. On the palate, it is crisp with a hint of tartness, and pleasing in its flavours minus the decadence of ghee and butter. The potato palya is creamy with the rich, savoury punch of onions. The chutney, though served in a \u2018ghatti\u2019 (solid consistency), is just as impactful as its runny avatar served with the idli and vade. \nRs. 45/-\n8/10\n\nChow Chow Baath \nThe khaara baath and kesari baath are cooked to a texture that is near \u2018runny\u2019. The veggies in the khaara baath change each day, this time around, it was the capsicum and one could taste its vegetal notes and the fried onions, alongside the toasty notes of the curry leaves and the sour twang of a drizzle of lemon. The kesari baath is pleasing and the sort that passes muster with the taste buds, making for a sweet end to a thindi experience at SN refreshments. \nRs. 46\n8/10\n\nCoffee\nRs. 12\n7.5/10\n\nADDRESS -  SN Refreshments, Phase 2, No. 11, 12th Cross Rd, 22nd Main, 2nd Phase, J.

Stay safe and happy eating!\n\nMutton Biryani \nThe dominant flavours in this biryani are that of the fresh ingredients, the naati ginger, garlic, coriander,mint etc., followed by a veil of the aromatic spices.

His sons, Gokul and Sarvan, would turn up at the cart after school to help their father, and in between preparing chaat, serving customers and doing the dishes, catch up on their homework under street lights. The years passed, Gokul became an engineer, his brother a cost accountant. Unable to find a suitable job though, Gokul turned back to his father\u2019s trade, and aided by his brother, has transformed the cart to a food truck. And not just any food truck, this engineer and cost accountant duo have aspirations to be the most hygienic street food operation serving authentic chaats! Made to the age-old recipes of their father who has since retired to farming, and with almost every component of the chaat prepared by them with the assistance of their mother, Shanthi Kuppuram. \nI drive up to Naidus Chats to see this for myself and also savour a few of their popular offerings made to that has made them the cynosure of their neighbourhood. \n\n\nMasala Puri \nBengaluru\u2019s popular \u2018local\u2019 chaat offering is served in an avatar that is spicy but doesn't subdue the aroma and warming spices of the \u2018masala\u2019 that is at the heart of this concoction.

The result is The LightHouse Restaurant, an airy space that is quite un-restaurant-like and more reminiscent of a South Canara home. Here, she serves coastal fare gleaned from family recipes and from her cooks who have worked in kitchens at legendary establishments along the West Coast. Keeping in mind her neighbourhood clientele, there\u2019s a smattering of Chinese and North Indian on the menu too, but it is the dishes from the Kundapur-Mangalore belt that are much in favour here, as I discovered during a recent lunch here.

A delicious combination when ladled over the dry roti. \nRs. 320 (usd 4.4)\n8.5/10\n\nBangude Pullimunchi\nYou can taste the sharp tartness of the tamarind (pulli) and the spicy punch of the munchi (chilli) in the gravy. The bangude (mackerel) is fresh, the masala though falls a bit short in steeping into the fish. An enjoyable curry nonetheless, with the appam.\nRs. 250 (usd 3.4)\n8/10\n\nRaagi Manni\nThe raagi manni makes for a soothing and light end to a meal here.\nRs. 60 (usd 0.8)\n8/10\n\nADDRESS -  The Lighthouse Restaurant, No. 62, 80 feet road, Near MS Ramaiah Hospital, opposite to apple store Devasandra, Village, RMV 2nd Stage, Ashwath Nagar, R.M.V. 2nd Stage, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560094; tel: +91 70262 36661 \nLOCATION TAG - https://g.page/TheLightHouseBengaluru?share\n\nLINKS TO VIDEOS MENTIONED:\nGourmet On The Road, Mangalore Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLri_37vf6mmqELg4kChPIYLp4EzfLS0lq\n\nHOTEL FISHLAND - https://youtu.be/EW7HRFTiDcI\n\nCHICKEN GHEE ROAST RECIPE - https://youtu.be/IdHyaXqs6Og\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

The jolada rottis are light and fluffy, the sort that when smeared with some butter, marry well with everything on the leaf, especially the chutneys, kempu chutney, shenga chutney and guralu, with some yoghurt. The rotti wrapped with the jhunka, salad and the gravy of the eggplant preparation, is a riot of flavours and textures. The pulses, the moth bean and sprouted mung, are satisfying, the badanekayi enngayi and dhonne menasinkayi, the sort that will have you calling for second helpings.

With a humble beginning, selling modaks online, Purnabramha has evolved into a full-fledged restaurant offering with multiple centres in India and overseas. I catch up with this firebrand entrepreneur at one of her restaurants in Bengaluru, watch the making of a unique maaswadi rassa, a dish from Narayangaon, before sitting down to a satisfying Maharashtrian meal that begins with an expected vada pav and sabudana vada but travels far beyond. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!\n\n\nSolkadi\nAn appetising start to the milk, sour kokum extract infused in spiced coconut milk.\nRs. 150 (usd 2)\n8/10\n\nVada Pav\nThe vada pav here is served in the traditional Maharashtrian style, a lightly flavoured batata vada in a laadi pav with a generous rub of kanda-lehsun chutney, choora, fried batter pearls for crunch, and lavangi, salted and fried green chillies. \nRs. 35 (usd 0.5)\n8.5/10\n\nSabudana Vada\nA textbook sabudana vada, crisp and crunchy on the outside and moist and yielding inside. The spicing is minimal in keeping with its reputation as a \u2018upavaschi faraal\u2019 or fasting snack. The sweet and sour yoghurt dip is a perky accompaniment to the vada.\nRs. 154 (usd 2) for 6 pieces.\n8/10\n\nKothmir Vadi\nThe sort of snack that you would find in a Maharashtrian home. Generous amounts of coriander (kothmir, in Marathi) combine with spices and chickpea flour in two versions, steamed and fried. I preferred the fried version. \nRs. 176 (usd 2.3)\n7/10\n\nCombo Main Course Platter\nA great plate to taste the depth and variety of Maharashtrian cuisine in dishes that aren\u2019t commonplace. The spicy rasa grips you by the throat, the soft and wholesome tandala chi bhakri (rice rotti) helps tone down the spicy fervour of the rasa. The maaswadi, a vegetarian\u2019s imaginative take on the bone and marrow concept, is an interesting play of flavours and textures - smooth, spicy chickpea paste that\u2019s stuffed with a mixture that comprises sesame seeds, coconut, peanuts, etc. if you like it spicy, combine the bhakri with the chilli thecha and onions. The bharleli vangi offers a flavourful bite, swathed in a nutty peanut based gravy,\nRs. 280 (usd 3.7)\n9/10\n\nThup Varan Bhat Nimbu \nA simple, soul-pleasing plate of mildly flavoured daal (varan) seasoned with toasted thup (ghee), served with rice.

The steamed noodles, combined with coconut cream, a touch of jaggery and almond flakes, is the delicate sort that dissolves when placed in the mouth. \nRs. 350 (usd 4.7)\n8/10\n\nModak\nLord Ganesha\u2019s favourite sweet, Purnabramha\u2019s modak is a must-order.

Mutton biryani, chicken biryani, homestyle mutton curry, chicken fry, liver fry, boti fry, raagi mudde, kothanur, east bangalore\n\nMallika Biriyani is the fascinating story of a computer engineer who began a biryani shop six years ago with an investment of Rs. 10,000 after a string of failed ventures. In the early days, he would procure a kilo of mutton each day, today the shop has evolved to a bustling biryani destination which procures over 500 kilos of meat on weekends to cater to the thronging crowds here. I make a 20-km trek through town to the far flung suburb of Kothanur in East Bengaluru to catch up with Venkatesh for a close look at his enterprise, and also taste the five or six dishes on offer here including his unique wood-fired biryani creation which comes across as a delicious confluence of various styles. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!\n\nMutton Curry\nA pleasing homestyle mutton preparation that\u2019s cooked slowly on a wood fire, the fat in the meat renders into the gravy giving the curry a lip-smacking unctuous richness. The meat slides off the bone, the curry is a great combination with the rice and raagi mudde. If you need one reason to make the trip to Mallika, this would be it!\nRs. 180 (usd 2.4)\n10/10\n\nChicken Fry\nMade in a flavour coriander-greenchilli-coriander masala, this is a zesty chicken dish. The meat is cooked perfectly down to the bone. \nRs. 80 (usd 1.1)\n8/10\n\nBoti Fry\nThe boti is soft, cooked well and spiked with loads of pepper. Its only fault however, its sandy griminess on the bite, which can be difficult to get past when you are eating offal.\nRs. 100 (usd 1.3)\n6/10\n\nLiver Fry\nA preparation, identical to the pepper-laced boti fry, it\u2019s a pity the flavourful warmth of the masala could not penetrate the \u2018tough-on-the-bite liver.\nRs. 100 (usd 1.3)\n7/10\n\nChicken Biryani\nThe biryanis are served in large portions, there\u2019s plenty of rice, and 5 or 6 pieces of chicken, which makes it a great biryani to share. On the nose, there\u2019s the smokey character from the wood-fire, you can taste the depth of flavour in the rice from the spices. The meat is moist, though mellow in its flavours and benefits from being eaten with the flavourful rice, that is a mixture of two varietals, the \u2018starchy\u2019 short-grained seeraga samba and the \u2018low on starch\u2019 medium-sized-grain, bullet variety.\nRs. 130 (usd 1.7)\n8.5/10\n\nMutton Biryani\nSeven or eight pieces of meat in a mutton biryani at Rs. 230 makes it great in terms of value, and perhaps also lends to its mass appeal. The spicing and masala is identical to the chicken version, but the character of the mutton, with a bit of fat, imbues the biryani with a mellow, warming flavour note that\u2019s more rounded on the palate. The meat is juicy, and has a bit of a bite. If you like your flavours a bit punchy, taste it with the sherva, the gravy of the mutton curry.\nRs. 230 (usd 3.1)\n9/10\n\n\nADDRESS -  Mallika Biriyan, Bileshivale Main Rd, Near SSR College, Essel gardens, Bileshivale, Karnataka 560077; tel +91 97418 49680\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/Sd6x5FcdckcF2xvt7\n\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

Not due to current covid 19 compulsions, but from when they began operations six years ago. In the current scenario, they have taken matters a step further as I discovered when I visited their flagship Jayanagar restaurant recently to savour their best selling masala dose. Turns out they have stopped making dosas altogether just because the three to four-minute ensuing wait for one would have customers crowding, making it difficult to maintain social distancing owing to space issues at this outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss financially especially in these difficult times\u201d, say the founders, but \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to compromise with the wellbeing of our customers and employees!\u201d \nMildly disappointed with the absence of the dosa, I sought solace in their equally pleasing idli vada and chow chow baath combo, the latter featuring a comforting khaara baath made with bansi rawa.

Simple omelettes, comforting toasts made with wholesome bread from their bakery, old-fashioned cutlets and sandwiches, the sort that can brighten up a dull day. In this episode, filmed just before they closed doors owing to the current crisis, I partake of a couple of their breakfast must-haves, their crowd-pleasing fish biriyani and a prawn fry that pays ode to the establishment\u2019s Keralan roots, and also take a look at how they tried their their best to keep serving customers in these trying times. I hope this landmark cafe, an indelible part of the city\u2019s history, emerges stronger in due course.

Shavings of cheese round off the flavours with savoury notes. \nRs. 170 (usd 2.3) \n8/10\n\nMutton Omelette\nFood doesn\u2019t have to be complicated, but the sort where it touches your soul. Like this simple omelette, beaten egg rolled around mutton mince that seasoned sparingly, sings the flavor of the meat. Savoured with some toast and butter, this is the breakfast of Koshy\u2019s champions!\nRs. 240 (usd 3.2) \n8/10\n\nChilli Chicken\nKoshy\u2019s version of this Sino-Indian staple that one will only find in India is generous in the peppers and onions, but lacking in some chilli punch one would expect. I also wish the sauce had permeated the chicken better. \nRs. 360 (usd 4.8) \n6/10\n\nFish Biriyani\nThis fish biriyani has been on Koshy\u2019s menu for decades and is the sort that requires one to redefine the notions of a biryani. Composed of plump steaks of kingfish, fried, cooked in a gravy and then topped with basmati rice, it isn\u2019t one for the biryani purist, but certainly makes an impression on the palate.\nRs. 430 (usd 5.8) \n7/10\n\nKerala Prawn Fry\nA delicious preparation of tiny fried chemmeen, prawns. One can taste the sweetness of the prawns juxtaposed against the toasty herbaceousness of the curry leaves, the singe of pepper, the lilt of coriander and other spices.\nRs. 500 (usd 6.7) \n9/10\n\nPlum Cake\nKoshy\u2019s plum cake has legions of fans not just in Bengaluru and the country but across the world. The fruits are macerated, rendering a slightly bitter edge against the sweetness and subtle spicing of this plum cake that is not as heady and alcohol-laced as some traditional cakes can be.

Located in almost every neighbourhood of the city, these traditional bakeries date back to the turn of the last century when two Iyengar brothers from the Ashtagrama (a cluster of eight villages) area in Hassan made their way to Bengaluru in search of livelihoods, and built on the legacy of British bakeries with their own customs and flavours. Over the years, more from the community followed in their footsteps, a trend exacerbated by the famine of the 50s which rendered agriculture in the villages unviable, leading to the rapid growth of Iyengar bakeries in Bengaluru, Mysuru and elsewhere in the South.  In this episode, I visit Sri Jayalakshmi Bakery, a 60-year old bakery that though rooted in its traditions has made space to evolve with the times. Needless to say, I also taste many of the calorie-laden but deliciously addictive goodies that have built for these time-honoured establishments a loyal fan following over the years.

A biryani that\u2019s nuanced in its depth of flavour and finds its roots in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, I catch the making of this traditional biryani from start to finish at the newest outpost of Bengaluru\u2019s largest chain of Andhra restaurants, Nandhana Palace. In doing so, I chat with second generation owner, Shweta Ravi, and learn of her family\u2019s commitment to culinary traditions over three decades, and also savour the many creations of the kitchens here that are now synonymous with Andhra cuisine. Hope you enjoy this one.

If you are a vegetarian looking to savour the flavour of the legendary chicken 65, this Nandhana Palace invention is perhaps the closest you can get.\nRs. 185 (usd 2.5) \n8/10\n\nSholay Kebab\nThis invention of the kitchens at Nandhana Palace is now synonymous with fried chicken Andhra style. Marinated in a yoghurt and spice masala and deep-fried, the result is a kebab that\u2019s moist to the core and seriously addictive.\nRs. 270 (usd 3.6) \n9/10\n\nChilli Chicken\nThe chicken is coated in a sauce of naati (local) green chillies that packs a ferocious, palate-numbing punch. If you have a high tolerance for chilli heat, do pop a few of the whole chillies floating in the dish to derive the painful yet satisfying pleasure of indulging in the Andhra chilli chicken. \nRs. 240 (usd 3.2) \n8/10\n\nChicken Kshatriya\nThis dish is an ode to the family\u2019s Kshatriya lineage. Stained bright yellow with turmeric, the fresh flavours of the masala hold to the chicken leg, making for a flavourful bite. A touch of cashew nut also renders a rich note to the sauce alongside the pungency of garlic. \nRs. 270 (usd 3.6) \n9/10\n\nAmravati Chicken\nBoneless morsels of chicken cooked in a semi-gravy rich in the savoury flavours of fried onions, curry leaves and hint of fennel. \nRs. 280 (usd 3.7) \n8/10\n\nMutton Pepper Fry\nThe meat is cooked to pink tenderness and its flavour reigns supreme beyond the pepper-rich masala.

You can also taste the underlying sweet acidity of the pineapple, a unique ingredient of the Nellore biryani. The meat has a bit of a bite, and is flavourful. \nRs. 290 (usd 3.9) \n10/10\n\nNati Kodi Biryani\nMade with short-grained seeraga samba rice, the nati kodi biryani takes over the palate with its spicy, green chilli laden flavours laced with the freshness of coriander and mint, and the toasty savouriness of fried onions.

Dining under the stars, I distinctly remember the food, a smattering of Parsi, Pan Indian and Continental, dished up, simply minus any pretence yet solid in its flavours, much like the character of the city I now call home. I learnt later that the restaurant came into being quite by accident, born out of a crisis after its owner, Rajesh Rajaram, having bought the property as an investment was unable to flip it owing to the adverse fall out of the first Gulf war. Over the years, Ebony has successfully weathered many crises, evolving multiple avatars, the city\u2019s most \u2018democratic\u2019 bar and more recently, an Asian restaurant. But sadly, the economic brunt of the current situation seems to have gotten the better of this Bengaluru bellwether. I visit Ebony for their last lunch service as they close shop to emerge stronger in a couple of months. Take care and stay safe.

And so they stayed back integrating into the local community, adopting culinary practices along the way.

The bun is a tad chewy, the banana making its presence felt on the palate and also aiding in its subtle sweetness.\nRs. 65 (usd 0.9) \n8/10\n\nSambar Vada\nThe sort of vada that one should perhaps be tasting with steaming hot idlis if one is looking for a substantial snack. The vada isn\u2019t crisp, but then that makes it of the perfect sponge to soak up the delicious Airlines Hotel sambar!\nRs. 65 (usd 0.9) \n7/10\n\nButter Masala Dosa\nLoaded with butter and the resulting calories, the dose is crackling crisp and ironically a hit with Bangaloreans for whom savouring this is a ritual after an early morning walk or jog in nearby Cubbon Park! But then, to be fair this certainly a dose that can make anyone weak. Lined with a red chutney and bearing a potato stuffing that also employs the crunch of carrots and beans, this is a dose you will love if you like it crisp. \nRs. 130 (usd 1.7) \n9/10\n\nAkki Rotti\nThe akki rotti is crisp around the edges and a tad dry on the bite. However, this filling snack is redeemed by the moistness of the gentle coconut-urugadle chutney, to take the spice quotient a few notches higher, taste it with the pungent byadgi chilli-garlic chutney. \nRs. 115 (usd 1.5) \n7/10\n\nChanna Bhatura\nA popular lunch order, this isn't your typical NorthIndian style dark-coloured and deep-flavoured chole. Get over that and you will be rewarded by a tasty combination of the chickpea with a steaming hot bhatura.\nRs. 155 (usd 2.05) \n7.5/10\n\nKesari Bath\nNot a lush ghee-laden version of a popular Bengaluru tiffin, the version here is rich in pineapple flavours. \nRs. 90 (usd 1.2) \n7/10\n\nBasundi\nIf you enjoy dairy-richness, you will dig the lushness of this dessert, milk thickened in a pan slowly and then fortified with nuts, cardamom powder and served chilled. \nRs. 120 (usd 1.6) \n8/10\n\nCoffee\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7) \n8/10\n\nADDRESS -  No 4, State Bank of India Rd, Shanthala Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560001; tel +91 80 2227 3786\nLocation Tag - https://goo.gl/maps/e4voDdkbLHrnzpaW7\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

And so we landed at Bheema\u2019s to savour a spicy Andhra bhojanam of fish fry, chilli chicken, mutton pepper fry, Guntur chicken, and a couple of biryanis, their staple Nellore version in addition to their ode to Bengaluru\u2019s dhonne style biryani! And needless to say, we also took a quick look behind the scenes to see how this popular restaurant is gearing up to serve customers in these challenging times. Enjoy and stay safe. \n\nFish Fry \nA tasty fry, though not the sort that will blow your socks off! It\u2019s a thin slice of fish, napped in a sprightly masala and fried crisp around the edges.\nRs. 370 (usd 4.9) \n7/10\n\nChilli Chicken\nNo Andhra non-vegetarian meal can be complete without a chilli chicken, rich in copious amounts of green chilli and pepper. The spice hit is tongue-numbing, but one that\u2019s vicariously addictive. The chicken is nice and juicy all the way down to the bone. \nRs. 270 (usd 3.6) \n8/10\n\nMutton Pepper Fry \nThe mutton is soft and yields to a gentle bite, draped in a pepper-onion masala. The meat is sheathed in some fat, which lends it its fulsome flavour.

You can taste the fervour of coriander, mint and green chillies alongside other ingredients like the marat moggu, cloves that are typically used in this one-pot rice and meat preparation. The meat slides off the bone, it is cooked as well as that! \nRs. 295 (usd 3.9) \n8/10\n\nChicken Biryani \nBheema\u2019s most popular dish, this traditional Nellore-style biryani is made with basmati rice. There\u2019s flecks of pineapple that go into this biryani and you taste its acidity juxtaposed against the aromatic flavours of cloves, cinnamon and other warming spices that the chicken and rice are cooked in. The meat is soft and juicy, however it is the delicate spicing of the biryani that makes an impression on the palate and lingers long after one has finished eating.\nRs. 260 (usd 3.4) \n9/10\n\nADDRESS - Bheema's, 31, Asha Building, Ground Floor, Church Street, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560001; tell: 080 2558 7389\nLOCATION TAG - https://maps.app.goo.gl/gaDweeSNAwped...\n\n\nLinks to other Bheema videos:\nTasting BHEEMA'S Most Popular ANDHRA VEG MEALS | MUTTON BIRYANI | Chilli Chicken | KITCHEN TOUR!\nhttps://youtu.be/8-igroeATQ0\n\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

From sanitisation of guests, their vehicles and belongings, to meticulous back of the house and kitchen processes aimed at fostering heightened levels of hygiene, to restaurant modifications that appear to not just take care of social distancing, but also airflow management, the team here seems to have made good use of the lockdown to ready services for the new normal. Hope you enjoy this episode, folks. Stay safe and happy eating!\n\nBrule\u0301e Of Goat Cheese And Herbs\nThis dainty brule\u0301e of goat cheese, crested with a passion fruit vinaigrette and basil seeds, is lusciously creamy with a smokey edge and contrasts sharply with the pickled beetroots served on the plate.

But in a format that the restaurant says is \u201csanitised and one that makes military-style fare convenient to families eating out.\u201d The important question, though, does the food deliver the tasty punch that one has come to expect of military hotels that have stood the test of time? Well, I visit the restaurant and grab a takeaway of most of their dishes to find my answer. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care and stay safe.\n\nChicken Kebab\nNot as crispy as a kebab would be when tasted at the restaurant, but the chicken is moist, juicy and flavourful. The chicken is cooked perfectly and peels off the bone. \nRs. 150 (usd 2) \n8/10\n\nCurry Leaf Chicken\nThe rich masala exudes the toasty herbaceousness of curry leaf, however its flavours have not penetrated the meat as one would have desired. \nRs. 200 (usd 2.6) \n6.5/10\n\nChicken Pepper Fry\nThe chicken is moist and napped in a flavourful masala rich in onions, tomatoes, coriander and curry leaf. The onions have been roasted to a deep brown. Definitely a dish to savour at Royanna.\nRs. 150 (usd 2) \n8.5/10\n\nMutton Fry\nThe meat has a bit of a bite, after all one is eating local, military-style dishes. The buttery, unctuous flavour of the fat that straddles the meat makes for a lush mouthfeel. The spicing is gentle and warming as opposed to the fiery chilli hit one sometimes encounters when dining local style. \nRs. 280 (usd 3.7) \n8.5/10\n\nChicken Liver Fry\nThe chicken is perfectly cooked to a creamy texture, its deep flavours complemented by the pepper laced green masala. \nRs. 150 (usd 2) \n9/10\n\nPalav\nCooked with chicken, but served minus the meat, the khaali palav is a spicy, military hotel tradition. The palav here though is mild on the palate, if you like to pick up the flavours, combine it with the sherva, the spicy broth that\u2019s served with the palav.\nRs. 120 (usd 1.6) \n7/10\n\nChicken Palav\nIf you are looking for a bold, military-style pulav, this is not it. But if you\u2019re looking for something mellow in flavour, this would be a good pulav to taste. The chicken benefits when tasted with the rice, the latter lending its spice notes. The pulav comes alive when combined with the spicy sherva.\nRs. 160 (usd 2.1)\n8/10\n\nMutton Palav\nThe palav is deeper in its flavours helped by the character of the red meat and also the fat that\u2019s clinging on to it. One needs to work though, to pry some meat from the bone, and also to chew on it. One of those rare occasions when I preferred the chicken palav to mutton. \nRs. 180 (usd 2.4)\n7/10\n\nADDRESS -  St Patricks Complex, unit 9, Brigade Rd, Shanthala Nagar, Bengaluru, 560025; tel +91 74836 15161\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/gS4RePt1HqfJF7uTA\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

Seated at the counter, always with a turban tied on his head, led to the eatery being popularly referred to as the Thalappakatti (thalappa - turban; katti - tied) biryani shop as opposed to its original name, Anandha Vilas, and thus was born an establishment that today owns (yes owns, not franchises) nearly 70 outposts of Dindigul Thalappakatti across the world. I visit the kitchen here to watch the cooking of their famed biryani made with small-grained seeraga samba rice, and also visit one of their eight restaurants in Bengaluru to get a takeaway bundle of their signature dishes. Hope you enjoy this episode. Happy eating and stay safe! \n\nKola Urundai\nSpiced roundels of mutton mince, it\u2019s unassuming form doesn't reveal the flavourful rush of spices it delivers on the palate. \nRs. 137 (usd 1.8) \n7.5/10\n\nMutton Chukka\nTiny morsels of meat, soft and yielding, with a springy bite. You can taste the grainy crunch of the coconut and the pepper hit, the perfect snack to accompany an evening tipple.\nRs. 253 (usd 3.1) \n9/10\n\nPeri Peri Chicken Chops\nThe smokey, spiciness of the peri peri masala certainly perks things up on the palate alongside a zing of acidity, perhaps from some vinegar. The mayo helps assuage the spicy assault of the peri peri chicken. \nRs. 300 (usd 4) \n8/10\n\nKuchi Mutton\nTender goat ribs, braised in a deep-roasted masala. The meat is soft and tender, encased in a thin veil of fat which adds to the flavour. The parotta makes for a handy bread to mop up the masala, this is a dish that epitomises the way in which DT cooks its mutton! A must-have!\nRs. 288 (usd 3.8) \n9/10\n\nKodaikanal Chicken Kozhambu\nThe chicken is moist and calming in its flavours, the spicing is mellow and cradled in creamy coconut milk. You bite into flecks of coconut as you savour this kozhambu.\nRs. 265 (usd 3.5) \n8/10\n\nVegetable Biryani\nThe seeraga samba rice heroes the Dindigul biryani powder that makes for the masala, the vegetables, beans, carrots and cauliflower, have been roasted in the masala thus imbuing in them the flavour of the biryani.\nRs. 210 (usd 2.8) \n7.5/10\n\nChicken Biryani\nThe rice is flavoursome and the chicken definitely benefits when savoured in its company. Taste it with the biryani gravy and its endearing tomato-acidity if you like to moisten things up on the palate. The boiled egg helps stretch the protein component on the plate.\nRs. 240 (usd 3.2) \n8/10\n\nThalappakatti Boneless Mutton Biryani\nThis is the biryani that\u2019s synonymous with Dindigul Thalappakatti, and therefore it is no surprise that they do it extremely well. The seeraga samba has not just trapped the flavour of the spices, but also the smoky aromas of the meat. The meat is soft, tender and moist. This is the sort of deep-flavoured, satisfying biryani that needs no accompaniment, either the gravy or the raitha.

In this recipe episode, we cook up a seer fish curry from scratch, including a vivacious masala that lends itself well to any mild-flavoured fish like pomfret, kingfish, ladyfish, or even prawns. Its beautiful bright reddish-orange hue comes from the combination of Kashmiri & Guntur chillies I prefer to use in this traditional preparation from namma Kudla. Traditionally, the curry is prepared atleast a couple of hours ahead of meal time, thereby allowing the fish to soak up the flavoursome masala.

Some confuse this dish with the Mumbai street food staple, \u2018anda bhurji\u2019, but the Parsi Akuri is a different dish altogether, from its nuanced spice notes, its depth of flavour, and its texture, comparable to a savoury custard. Growing up in Mumbai, this was a dish I would savour in Irani restaurants with some kadak brun pav, or in Parsi homes.

In this video from our earliest culinary explorations, we travelled to the tiny fishing village of Kovalam in Tamil Nadu to spend a day with Selvam. We took a boat ride into the ocean where this sunburnt fisherman shared with us a moving account of what it takes to carry on with the traditions of his community. On our return, we stopped at his favourite stall to taste some seafood fries. Hope you find this episode an interesting watch, and take a moment to remember not just the fishing community but the many growers and producers who must face enormous difficulties to bring to us the food that nourishes and sustains us, especially in these unforeseen times.

His son, Ganesh, seeks to keep alive his late father\u2019s legacy in a tiny shop, aptly named Dose Manjanna, serving a smattering of traditional and some accidentally inspired creations, like the buttery, spicy Salem Idli. Concocted on a cold, rainy night, when his store had run out of hot idlis, in a bid to acquiesce to a customer\u2019s demand for hot food just prior to the latter\u2019s boarding a bus for Salem. \n\nIn this #gourmetontheroad episode, Food Lovers\u2019 editor, Kripal Amanna tastes the Salem Idli, a scrumptious ghee onion dose and a couple of other tiffin treats that has Jayanagar\u2019s denizens crowding this eatery at all times. Hope you enjoy this episode.\n\nSALEM IDLI\nThis Idli roasted in butter, sings the flavour of the butter with the spicy, grainy crunch of the podi. Eat it piping hot, just off the tawa. When it cools down, pair it with the spicy hurigadale (fried gram) chutney.\nRs. 20 (usd 0.3)\n8.5/10\n\nButter Idli \nThatte idli roasted on a hot tawa over melted butter, with lashings of butter and served with a dollop of butter, this is sheer decadence. The idli loses some its fervour as it begins to cool, and that\u2019s when you taste its slight tartness.\nRs. 20 (usd 0.3)\n8/10\n\nOpen Onion Dose\nServed folded, this crisp, kadak dose was the highlight for me. Dripping with ghee and butter, smeared with chutney podi, a generous sprinkling of moist, crunchy onions, this dose is flavourful enough to be eaten on its own. The chutneys served alongside play a distant second fiddle to this open onion dose. \nRs. 40 (usd 0.6)\n9/10\n\nMysore Masale Dose\nThe masale is smeared into a paste with chutney podi, butter and onions as the dose is roasted on the tava. I expected it to be robust in its flavours, however the potatoes seem to tone down the aggression of the chutney podi, making this a gently-spiced bite. Mix together the gram chutney, chutney podi and butter that\u2019s served alongside, and combine with the dose to savour a spicy mouthful. \nRs. 40 (usd 0.6)\n8/10\n\nShavige Baath \nThe shavige baath here is light, fluffy and springy, tossed in a chitranna or lemon rice masala. Studded liberally with peanuts, fried lentils, flecks of green chilli and roasted curry leaves, it makes a gentle yet persuasive impression on the palate. If you like it spicy, enjoy it with the smokey tomato-red chilli-roasted gram chutney.\nRs. 30 (usd 0.4)\n8.5\n\n\nADDRESS -  Dose Manjanna, No 20, 12th Main, Near Old Sub Registrar Office, Behind Reliance Jewellery, near Cool Joint Junction, 4th T Block East, KV Layout, Jayanagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560011; tel +91 86604 72706\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/qR9ALXXmRBrGSbYe6\n\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

The chutneys are replaced by piquant raw mango salsa and a refreshing tomato salsa.\nRs. 295 (usd 4.1)\n8/10\n\nCurried Cauliflower & Beetroot Soup\nA vegan offering at Street Storyss, the warming spiced cauliflower broth combines with the sweet and sour beetroot puree in a lively jig on the palate. \nPrice na\n8.5/10\n\nPomegranate Kombucha \nA refreshing mocktail of fermented kombucha and fresh pomegranate.\nRs. 250 (usd 3.5)\n7/10\n\nTibetan Laping Roll\nThese translucent noodle rolls deliver batons of pickled cucumber and watermelon in a chilled sweet and sour crunch, swathed with the nuttiness of sesame soy and the warming heat of ginger. \nRs. 325 (usd 4.5)\n9/10\n\nThai Corn Cake\nCorn pureed and coaxed into a cake before being cubed and fried.

Enjoy! \n\nSteamed Vegetable Momo\nStuffed with a cabbage, carrot, bean and capsicum filling that\u2019s enlivened with a ginger-garlic and green chilli paste, this is a savoury momo, quite flavourful for a veggie option.  If you like it spicy, go for the chilli sauce. \nRs. 60 (usd 0.8) for 8 pieces\n7.5/10\n\nSteamed Paneer Momo\nI was quite cynical of this momo before I tasted it. But one bite and I changed my mind! If I were a vegetarian, I would be quite happy with this momo stuffed with soft paneer and slivers of green chilli. Flavourful enough to be eaten on its own minus the chutney.\nRs. 70 (usd 1) for 8 pieces\n7.5/10\n\nSteamed Chicken Momo\nThe chicken momo had spent a bit longer in the steamer than necessary, and therefore weak in the strength of the dumpling wrap. The chicken stuffing is the consistency of a soft paste, and though flavourful, a bit shy in asserting itself on the palate. I wish this momo was served hot though.\nRs. 70 (usd 1) for 8 pieces\n7/10\n\nFried Chicken Momos\nThese deep-fried momos are crispy and crunchy outside and doughy inside. An interesting contrast of textures that makes for an interesting bite.

Kothanur Kitchen favours cooking over wood fire and a strict no-refrigeration policy, ensuring that everything that is served is cooked with fresh ingredients for the day. \n\nFood Lovers\u2019 Editor visits the restaurant to savour some of the most popular dishes served here, from a Mutton Kola Urundai to Egg Boti Fry, a vivacious Netholi Curry and more. Enjoy! \n\nKothu Parotta\nRobust in its spicing, this parotta that has soaked up the egg masala and chicken sherva will transport you to the street stalls of Salem. \nRs. 80 (usd 1.1)\n8/10\n\nMutton Kola Urundai\nLove the texture of these spiced mutton mince balls, it's got a bit of a crunch as you bite into it but is yielding inside. The meat hasn\u2019t been ground to a paste, and the spicing is gentle, leaves behind a happy warmth on the palate. \nRs. 200 (usd 2.8)\n9/10\n\nEgg Boti Fry \nThe boti is prepped and cooked rather well too. There is none of the raw \u2018animal\u2019 scent that one smells if offal meat isn't cleaned well. \nRs. 150 (usd 2.1)\n8/10\n\nNaatu Kozhi Fry \nAt first bite, I felt the meat was a bit too tough, although I enjoyed the flavours of the fry - the tartness of the tomato, the mild sweetness of the onions and the savouriness of the Salem masala. However, as you chew on the chicken, it releases the flavours of the masala it has been cooked in. \nRs. 200 (usd 2.8)\n8.5/10\n\nNethli Kozhambu\nThis Sunday special fish curry  at Kothanur Kitchen combines the humble nethili fish with the puckeringly sour raw mango in a curry pot that\u2019s cooked slowly over a wood fire. \nRs. 150 (usd 2.1)\n9/10\n\n\nNaati Kozhi Kuruma \nThe chicken is cooked with the skin, which lends a fulsome flavour to the kuruma. The kuruma in itself is rather delicately flavoured, allowing one to savour the flavour of the meat and the lingering warmth of the spices.\nRs. 200 (usd 2.8)\n8.5/10\n\nMutton Kuruma \nThe fat flavour in this kuruma is quite pronounced, I also found the meat a tad chewy. On a positive note, the gravy benefits from the richness of the fat on the meat. \nRs. 180 (usd 2.5)\n7/10\n\nChicken Biryani \nThe rice is quite flavourful once you get past its slight stickiness. On the palate you taste the freshness of the mint and coriander, the acidity of the tomatoes amidst the spices.  \nRs. 130 (usd 1.8)\n8/10\n\nMutton Biryani \nThe mutton biryani is restrained in its spice notes and spotlights the flavour of the meat. The rice is cooked perfectly in this naati, country style biryani, with the fat lending its deep savoury unctuousness.\nRs. 200 (usd 2.8)\n8.5/10\n\nKalaki \nIn case you haven\u2019t had enough of the meaty preparations here, the custardy goodness of the kalaki, an egg and chicken curry mix that's cooked to the point where the egg begins to coagulate, provides the perfect end to a Kongunadu meal.  \nRs. 30 (usd 0.4)\n7.5/10\n\n\nADDRESS -  Kothanur Kitchen, Sy.

You can smell the gentle sweet aroma of the batter which is perfectly fermented rendering a springy fluffiness to the idli. The thick, spicy lentil chutney with flecks of dry coconut makes for a great accompaniment.\nRs. 20 (usd 0.3)\n9/10\n\nChitranna 30/ 20\nYou can taste the gentle tartness of the lemon, the flavour of cumin and pointed notes of green chilli on the palate, the lentils in the seasoning make for a nice bite.\nRs. 20/30 (usd 0.3/ 0.4) for half/ full portion\n7/10\n\nPulav \nA flavourful pulav with the lingering warmth that comes from spices such as cinnamon and cloves, this is what draws customers to SSP. There\u2019s the spicy kick of green chilli, but juxtaposed against the other ingredients, its hit is not the sort that obliterates your tastebuds. The seasoned chutney served alongside adds a layer of pleasing nuttiness. \nRs. 20/30 (usd 0.3/0.4) for half/ full portion\n8.5/10\n\nMosaru Anna  \nGentle on the palate, this provides cooling respite if one has overindulged in the spicy pulav and chutney.\nRs. 20/30 (usd 0.3/ 0.4) for half/ full portion\n7.5/10\n\nADDRESS -  SSP refreshments, 10th Cross Rd, Jaya Nagar 1st Block, Someshwara Nagar, Mavalli, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560011; tel +91 86604 72706\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/jP638xbjdGBY55EUA\nNote: It\u2019s located in a tiny lane with absolutely no parking for 4-wheelers, best to ride here or resort to cabs/ autos/ public transport to get here.\n\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the \u2018join\u2019 button below or on the home page.

The sweetness of the spices, the star anise, the mild astringency of the cloves, the fresh bite of the herbs, the pointed pungency from the green chillies, the tartness of tomato and the lime. The ghee coats the rice with a film of lushness, you can smell the smokiness from the dum. The chicken is delicate in its flavour, and not as effusive.

Specialising in Konkani and coastal Mangalorean cuisine, the most popular item here is the seafood thaali.\n\nFood Lovers\u2019 Editor, Kripal Amanna visits revisits this establishment and savours not just the special \u2018limited\u2019 seafood thaali, but a host of other delicacies like the crab curry, bangude (mackerel) fry and prawns masala amongst others. Enjoy!\n\nSpecial Limited Fish Thaali \nThis thaali, complete with a fish curry, fish fry, vegetable of the day, rice, buttermilk and yoghurt had the potential to be a rather satisfying fish meal, especially given the fulsome flavours of the kaane curry. However, it was let down by the kingfish fry that although swathed in a spirited masala and crumb-fried, wasn't the epitome of freshness. Next time, I would order either a fish curry or the limited thaali that arrives minus the fry, but offers terrific value at at Rs. 180, and a fish fry separately.\nRs. 320 (usd 5.3)\n7/10\n\nBangude Fry \nThis is what a fish fry should be all about. The mackerel was fresh, plump and juicy. Fried such that the masala formed a thick crust. You can taste the heat of the chilli and the tang of the tamarind in the masala, this combination of spicy and sour made for the perfect complement to the oily flavours of the mackerel. \nRs. 160 (usd 2.2)\n10/10\n\nPrawns Fry\nYou can taste the sweetness of the sea prawns notwithstanding the robust masala. The prawns are fresh, springy to the bite and the masala coating this crustacean is fried to a delightful crust. Order these for sure.\nRs. 295 (usd 4.1)\n9/10\n\nMarvai Sukka \nThe clams are wanting in their flavour. All that you taste is the masala, the clams barely make their presence felt. \nRs. 160 (usd 2.2)\n6/10\n\nCrab Masala \nThe crab is delicious, plump with briny-sweet flavoured flesh. Chew on the crab shell unabashedly to lap up every ounce of its goodness that also carries the flavour of the curry. The curry too has tones of the crab \u2018sweetness\u2019.

Enjoy! \n\nSHUKTONI \nThe traditional way to start a Bengali lunch, the Shuktoni, made with cow\u2019s milk, sun dried lentil dumplings and flavoured with wild celery seeds, radhuni, is rich in vegetables. \nRs. 195 (usd 2.7)\n9/10\n\nBHAJA MUNGER DAL\nThis is a comforting lentil dish, mellow in its flavours, embellished with fresh peas and hint of cumin in its ghee seasoning. \nRs. 185 (usd 2.6)\n8/10\n\nBEGUN BHAJA \nThick, fleshy slices of eggplant, roasted on a tawa. The pulpy \u2018begun\u2019 has a sweetish edge contrasted by the slightly bitter tones of its skin.

The Kolkata bhetki is swathed in a paste of mustard, coconut and green chillies, wrapped in a banana leaf and roasted, rendering the fish firm to the touch but moist inside. Rs. 475 (usd 6.7)\n\n9/10\n\nDAAB CHINGRI \nThe sweetness of the coconut milk and tender coconut, the punch of mustard, the grainy texture of poppy seeds and the heat from green chillies come together to make this flavourful curry.  \nRs. 595 (usd 8.3)\n8.5/10\n\nKATLA JHOL\nThe plump piece of katla, a pond fish, is fried first before being introduced to the curry which has a lilt of fennel in its flavours.
